emailed um all\nthe information to to Mr Eid on May the\n2nd\n2024 um so Mr Eid said he would stay in\ncontact with the city engineer because\nthat's the first step is to see what\ntype of access he

to answer\nany questions council do you have any\nquestions no okay we move on now is the\ntime that members of the public May\ncomment on items that are not on the\nagenda Mr Moreno are there any speaker\ncards this evening uh yes madame mayor\nwe do have one from Miss Miss Bera\nJimenez um she wants to address the\ncouncil on ADA compliance Miss\nmenz um good evening council members my\nname is Bertha humanz and I am a and I\nhave a small business in our city of\nparamont and I am here today to bring\nattention to a critical issue impacting\nsmall businesses in our city\nI am currently facing an ADA compliance\nlawsuit and I want to share my\nexperience and shed light on the growing\nproblem over the past years there has\nbeen a surge in ada8 compliance lawsuits\nfiled by few individuals and attorneys\nwho seem to be exploiting the legal\nsystem one such individual has filed\nover 200 lawsuits in a very short period\nthese actions appear to be less\npromoting accessibility and more about\nextracting settlements\nfrom small business owners who are often\nunaware of specific compliance\ndetails as a small business owner I\nstrive to ensure my business is\naccessible and welcoming to all however\nnavigating the complexities of ada8\ncompliance can be challenging without\nproper guidance when we apply for a\nbusiness license we receive no\ninformation about ADA requirements the\nlack of information leaves us vulnerable\nto these opportunity\nuh opportunistic\nlawsuits I believe our city can do more\nto support small businesses in\nunderstanding and complying with Ada\nregulations I understand there are plans\nto create a workshop to address these\nissues and I wholeheartedly support the\ninitiative providing comprehensive\ninformation and resources at the time of\nobtaining a business license would be\nsignificant first step for protecting\nbusiness owners from un warranted legal\naction moreover I want to bring your\nattention Senate Bill 585 introduced by\nSenator Roger n this bill aims to\nprotect small businesses from being\n\nextorted through frivilous Ada lawsuits\nI urge the council to consider\nsupporting this bill and to explore\nadditional measures we can take locally\nto safeguard our small business\ncommunity in conclusion I ask the\ncouncil to prioritize this issue and\nprovide more robust support and\ninformation for small businesses owners\nregarding ADA\ncompliance by doing so we can help\nprevent exploitation ensure true\naccessibility and create fair\nenvironment for\nall I want to mention that I care deeply\nabout the Ada community at one point in\nmy life I was handicapped and unable to\nwalk for nearly a\n\nyear unfortunately\nlawsuits can make an end to a business\nowner's livehood which ultimately hurt\nincluding those in the ad8 SE protect\nthank you for your time and\nconsideration and I'm sorry it's\nemotional for me thank you thank you\nBera for bringing that too thank you\nBera

proposal is to uh\nreplace existing Zony regulations and\nthis as um John Moreno mentioned this is\na pdps Zone and pdps is the planned\n\ndevelopment with performance standards\nZone this zone is it's intended to be a\na flexible type of Zone um to have some\nwe considered creative types of zoning\nregulations so kind of thinking outside\nthe box and there are a number of them\nthroughout the city some are housing\nsome are commercial based this one is\ncommercial based it um has been in\neffect since uh\n1987 um when the then applicant um\napplied to ask for something a little\nmore flexible so it it's a little more\nrestrictive in some areas doesn't allow\nsome uses but it opens up to to others\nso the bottom line for this proposal is\nthat that the like John mentioned the\npdps Zone would would stay the same it's\nstill pdps but it would be expanded to\nallow for an urgent care facility and\nactivities and services for disabled\nYouth and that that would be with a\nconditional use permit so we'll get into\nthat in a moment um the Planning\nCommission reviewed this um proposal and\nthey recommended um approval a couple\nweeks ago two other applications are are\nforthcoming there is one application\nthat's already been submitted um in\ntandem with this that is a development\nreview application uh\nDr a um so that's that's for the design\nthat I'll get into um the development\nreview board will review the the\nproposed design in a couple months and\num then a conditional use permit that\n\nhas not been submitted yet but that\nwould be a requirement a cup for the the\nuse for these uses we'll be talking\nabout so before you as a um an aerial\nphoto you'll see a landre is on the\nbottom running east and west and then\n\nit's northeast corner of Virginia the\nproperty is outlined in in red just get\noriented there nice purple color tree\nthere um so the again the building\nhere's a view looking Northwest the\nbuilding was constructed in the early\n80s you can see it's you know concrete\nstyle um little on maybe a little on the\non the plane side but it but it serves\nit's very\nfunctional and the um so the applicant\nis actually looking to to buy the\nproperty the applicant is the applicant\nis is in escrow and you can tell from\nthe signs there are a couple businesses\nthere um on the left side or the you\nknow facing theer Boulevard there's an\naccounting or bookkeeping business and\nthen the property the current property\nowner um the seller um is uh kind of see\nthe sign there s sarus um custom covers\nI think so it's kind of um an upholstery\nor very very specialized type of um\nsewing type of Business\nInteriors uh the both of these\nbusinesses are are winding down they're\nin the process of winding down um their\noperations\nso with this project the applicant is\nproposing they they would if they were\nto buy the sale goes through and with\nthe approval of of uh this zone change\num the applicant is proposing to\nrepurpose the building as a new Urgent\nCare\nCenter um as as part of it and also\n\nother community related uses and there\nwould be kind of a um a complete uh well\nthe applicant has a interesting and\nunique vision for Education after school\nclasses and tutoring and the um the main\n\nbeneficiaries would be dis disabled\nyouth again the Urgent Care and there\n\nwould be as part of that uh focus on on\nchildren there'll be some play areas um\na music studio and karate studio all\ndedicated to to the youth there are 30\num there would be 30 parking stalls\nincluding two Americans with\nDisabilities at compliant\nspaces and here you have the uh the site\nplan so the again aers on the bottom\nright East and West um the building is\nis in that bluish color and you'll see\nthe other um parking spaces and the um\nanother nice tree there so with the um\nzone change so the this new zoning these\nzoning regulations would replace the\nexisting it's it's pretty pretty close\nbut we'll get into the the details so so\nas far as the use changes it would allow\n\nfor uh Studios so Studios would be\npermitted and what um types of Studios\ncould be uh art arts and crafts music\nstudio recording studio martial arts\nstudio and this is a business category\ncategory that's allowed um all over\nParamount in the in AA call it a\ntraditional Zone the C3 General\ncommercial zone so that would bring\nwhat's pretty standard in other zones to\nto this this property that would not\ntake a conditional use\npermit um now the other listed uh\nbusiness uses would require a\nconditional use permit and those are\nchildren's play areas associated with\neducation Andor tutoring uh medical\ndental and optometrist uses including\nurgent care facilities uh services and\nprograms for for persons who have one or\nmore disabilities and last youth\nactivity\nprograms the um there there are a few\nminor changes to the um regulations\nagain it was developed in the late 18\n1980s 1987 it's a little outdated so\nactually to help our Public Safety\ndepartment out with some of their\nconcerns we've added What's um some of\nthe uh types of regulations that are\ncommon other parts of the city like no\nno outdoor no exterior window bars um no\nrazor wire or barbed wire would be\npermitted um just kind of the typical or\ndrop tolerant Landscaping um organic\n\nwaste requirements like we require all\nover\ntown so in summary a conditional use\npermit requirement um would be um it\nwould is proposed for for these New Uses\nand that's very important and that's to\nensure through the cup process um\nthrough a public hearing with the\nPlanning Commission that you um that the\napplicant would provide enough parking\nwould make sure that there's uh no\nimpacts to the resident residential\nneighborhood to the north um traffic\nimpacts parking that kind of thing again\na development review application is\nforthcoming and that's to make sure that\nthe outside um looks nice and um just\nI've looked at the proposal and it it it\nwould be a um a a nicer building you\nknow a little more color um a nice entry\non this um at this view that you're\nlooking at on the\nbottom so with that we are recommending\nthat you read by title only wave further\nreading and introduce the ordinance this\num area and place it on the May 28th\nagenda for adoption so that concludes my\npresentation and the applicant is also\nhere if you have any questions for the\napplicant\nokay thank you John um now I will open\nthe public hearing are there any\ncomments in favor of this\nitem no madame mayor there have been no\ncomments submitted in favor are there\nany comments in opposition and none have\nbeen submitted in opposition either may\nI

to8 9 to8 it'll be\noperating at the same time as the\nprograms for the kids as yes yes yes\nokay is there a separate entrance or\nanything or there is separate entrance\nbetween the Urgent Care and the and\nother activities each each one would\nhave their own opening cord okay I just\nwanted to check that thank\nyou so you made a motion I moved it\nalready so you yep\nsecond okay Miss loose may I have roll\ncall please council member almost yes\nvice mayor lemons yes mayor delgo\nyes next is consider consideration for\nan update Madam mayor if we can pause\napologize no problem if you can pause\nuntil uh council member stallins comes\nback thank you\nokay next is consideration of an update\nto the Home Improvement program\nguidelines Mr Moreno may I may we have\nthe report please absolutely Madame\nmayor uh for decades we've run a very\nsuccessful Home Improvement program uh\nfor qualifying low low-income residents\num which also includes our seniors our\nsubsidy however has remained pretty flat\nover the years and we all know in this\nday and age construction costs have gone\nthrough the roof uh to keep Pace with\ninflation however we're recommending\nthat we increase our subsidy and so with\nthat I'll turn it over to miss Solano\nwho will handle this item so thank you\nJohn good evening Madame mayor members\nof the city\ncouncil so tonight's item is an proposed\nupdate to the Home Improvement program\nguidelines the Home Improvement program\nis geared towards assisting income\nqualifying Paramount residents\nin making home repairs to owner occupied\nsingle family homes and most recently\nexpanded to include owner occupied\nmobile homes on fixed foundations the\nHome Improvements focus on hazardous\nstructural conditions while improving\ndisability access and addressing\nbuilding and health code violations the\nprogram is funded with the use of\nfederal Home Improvement partnership\n\nfunds and now also includes the use of\ncdbg funds as approved by Council in May\nof last\nyear so why are we asking to update the\nHome Improvement program guidelines well\nas John mentioned um it's because the\nongoing rise in construction costs due\nto inflation and exterior factors such\nas covid causing a shortage in the\nsupply chain and prices to increase the\nwork items covered under the program are\nfor the most part high cost ticket items\nwhich in most cases far exceed the\ncurrent Grant and loan amounts afforded\nto a qualified\nhomeowner the average bid proposal for\nprojects in fiscal year\nskyrocketed to\n50,100 in fiscal year\n\n2024 while the total Grant award and\nloan amount combined available to an\nincome qualifying resident is a maximum\nof\n29,600 leaving a homeowner to come out\nof pocket which in most cases\ndiscourages the resident from proceeding\nwith the pro process and opting instead\nto withdraw their application from the\naltogether now under the current program\nguidelines we have two available funding\nsources uh actually funding options\navailable uh both of which requires an\napproved owner to contribute a certain\npercentage to the overall cost of\nconstruction along with a maximum of\n8,000 zero interest loan option the\nmaximum Grant award amount An approved\nincome qualified senior citizen can be\nawarded is\n24,300 while the maximum amount for an\napproved low moderate income household\n21,600 now for comparison the updated\nguidelines or the proposed guidelines uh\nwill streamline the process and um raise\nthe maximum Grant award up to\n30,000 and a maximum loan amount of up\n\nto 50\n,000 it\nwill no longer require an upfront owner\ncontribution the program guidelines and\napplication will incorporate the most\nrecent HUD requirements and best\npractices and simplify the overall\napplication\n\nprocess so in summary it will eliminate\nThe Upfront owner contribution increase\nthe grant award amount up to a maximum\n\nof\n$30,000 increased the zero interest loan\namount up to a maximum of\n$115,000 and there is no fiscal impact\n\nas currently in FY\n2324 there is already cdbg and home\npartnership funds already\n\nallocated and most importantly it'll\nhave an immediate and greater impact in\nthe community the new guidelines meet\nthe goals of the five-year Consolidated\nplan in making improvements to the\nexisting housing stocks with within City\nLimits that has been approved by Hud but\nmost importantly let's keep in mind that\nthe home that is approved upon stays in\nParamount and add adds value to the\nneighborhood while helping to eliminate\nblight enhancing curb appeal and\nbenefiting benefiting the community at\nlarge and with that it is recommended to\napprove the changes to the Home\nImprovement program guidelines and I'm\navailable to answer any questions you\nmay have okay thank you so do my\ncolleagues have any questions I do\n\nMadame mayor\num this is um the one that's funded\nthrough the CBD G dollars so do they\nhave guidelines that we have to follow\nas far as what um the moderate and low\nincomes are they do and so do you know\nthose off the top here what the income\nguidelines are yes it's based on the\nhousehold total income but it's also um\nit's less stringent than the home funds\nIt's a combination of both home funds\nand cdbg funds that'll be used for the\nHome Improvement program and depending\non the number of people um there is a\nmaximum for each\nhousehold a maximum income level maximum\ninome so do you happen to know what the\ndollar amount is on that moderate one or\nyou're saying because it depends on how\nmany people are living in the home it\ndepends on how many people are in the\nhome so but do they then have a an the\num total income of that or does it lower\nif there's more\npeople like regardless I know you have\nto consider everybody's income that's\nthere but let's say there's one person\nand it's 30,000 and there's 10 people\nand it's 30,000 does that change the\ncircumstances no the as as long as\nthey're qualifying under the income the\ndollar amount the dollar amount so\nthat's to word will be up to a maximum\nof 30 depending on the cost of the\nproject altogether so do you happen to\nknow what the highest dollar amount is\nthat they could have under the moderate\nincome one I\nbelieve I I don't recall off the top of\nmy head but it might be like 90\nsome thousand to 90 90,000\n91,000 and um would that meet both those\ncriteria that you said the two different\nfunds or just the one no be meet both\nand the other fund that's less stringent\ncan you go higher in income no it's the\nsame they have to stay the same okay the\nonly difference is um the after rehab\nvalue so it's it's not applicable under\ncdbg funding but but under home funds it\nis he because I thought I heard you say\nthat after rehab value I wasn't so we're\nstill talking about the income of the\nhousehold though right yes okay all\nright thank you you're welcome are there\nany more comments or questions among\ncouncel no Madam mayor okay is there a\nmotion for this item I'll move second\nokay Miss loose may I have a roll call\nplease council member olos yes council\nmember aqu Stallings yes vice mayor\nlemons yes mayor delad\nyes next is the public hearing on the 24\n2024 2025 oneyear action plan for the\nCommunity Development block grant and\nhome investment partnership programs Mr\nMoreno may we have a report please yes\nmadame mayor um this is an annual\nrequirement that we do every year by Hud\nthis the city council has to adopt an\naction plan before we start using both\ncdbg and home funds in our next fiscal\nyear so that's what's before you tonight\n\nand our management analyst and planning\nMiss so heran who's still at the podium\num will handle this item as well so take\nit away thank you John good evening\nMadame mayor members of the city council\nas John mentioned uh this item before\nyou is a one-year action plan for the\nfiscal year 2024\n2025 in compliance with the US\nDepartment of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment regulatory requirements\nthat was just to make sure I was still\nawake sorry okay\n\num so the five-year Consolidated plan\nthat Council approved May of 2022 is the\ncity's road map that informs the public\nof the city's priorities objectives and\nstrategies to address the city's Housing\nand Community needs and resources using\ncdbg and home funds the FY 2425 one-year\naction plan is the third of five annual\naction plans required for every year of\nthe approved Consolidated plan and it is\na planning document that informs the\npublic of how the city plans on\n\nimplementing the available resources to\nmeet the priority needs of the community\nidentified in the Consolidated plan as\nrequired by Hud the city made the plan\navailable to the public for a third\n30-day commenting period and published\nthe notice in the Press Telegram on\nApril 9th\n2024 at the time of preparing this\nreport HUD had not released their final\nallocations however HUD released the\nfinal allocations last week and\ntherefore the allocated the allocations\nreferenced in this slide reflect Hud's\nfinal\nallocations as an entitlement City\ndefined by Hud as a metropolis as\nmetropolitan cities with populations of\nat least\n50,000 Paramount is scheduled to receive\na little over 7\n131,000 in cdbg funding which is about\n$29,500 less than the previous year's\nallocation in addition the city will\nreceive about2\n47,000 in home funding which is\napproximately\n$555,000 less than last year and at this\ntime there aren't any home program\nincome\nfunds but best practices include an\nassessment of the approved consolidate\n\nConsolidated plan when preparing the\none-year action plan in the event the\ncity's available resources or Community\nneeds have changed the following slides\nhighlight the activities being proposed\nin fiscal year 2024\n2025 so the proposed fy2 2425 action\nplan continues to fund Administration\nand fair housing along with the City\nSenior enrichment program which includes\nFitness classes walking Club sewing\nknitting club and of course dancing for\nthose uh seniors that are 55 and old\nover to foster a healthy and active\nlifestyle within the senior community\ncdbg dollars pays for the salaries and\nbenefits of the employees directly\ninvolved in running these activities\nadditionally Alleyway improvements will\ncontinue as an eligible activity that\naligns with the public infrastructure\nImprovement strategic goal in the\namended Consolidated plan preserving and\nimproving public infrastructure is not\nonly an necessity but also aesthetically\npleasing so we are again asking uh to\nutilize 165,000 from the unallocated\n\ncdbg fund along with\n250,000 from the upcoming annual\nallocation for a total of 415,000 to\nfund this activity\nfurthermore given the Aging housing\nstock and as previously discussed in the\nprevious\npresentation uh the cost of home repairs\nhas gone\nup so it is essential to preserve the\nsupply of affordable housing to low and\nmoderate income residents of single\nfamily dwelling and mobile homes on\nfixed\nfoundations last year Council approved\nthe use of cdbg funding for this\nactivity which serves to enhance the\ncity's existing homef funded Home\nImprovement program\nthere aren't any changes being proposed\nto the eligible home funded activities\nwe will continue to fund um Home\nImprovements and our regular\nAdministration\ncost and with that it is recommended\nthat Council conduct a public hearing\nadopting the one-year action plan for 25\nfor the fiscal year 2024\n2025 this concludes my presentation I'm\navailable to there any questions you may\nhave um now I'll open the public hearing\nare there any comments in favor of this\nitem\nMadam madam are there have been no\ncomments submitted in\nfavor and are there any comments in\nopposition and none have been submitted\nin opposition either okay may I have a\nmotion to close the public hearing so\nmoved second okay Miss loose may I have\na roll call please council member alos\nyes council member Stallings yes vice\nmayor lemons yes mayor delgadio\nyes um Madam mayor before you call for\nthe question I have I just have a\nquestion yes you may go ahead um vice\nmayor the um Alleyways that are going to\nbe paved does this take care of all of\nthe Alleyways or a portion of them a\nportion of it um they have to follow the\ncdbg low area maps approved by Hud and\nthere's certain areas throughout the\ncity that are designated ated as low and\nour Public Works team who's amazing and\ntheir uh city engineer is working on\ndeveloping the current area map for f\nschool year\n2425 and when it says improvements is\nthat simply repaving is that yet I'll\nturn it over to Adrian as you can\nfurther um it's actually in some cases\ncomplete\nreconstruction complete what\nreconstruction of the alley so like give\nme an example of that what do you mean\nreconstru like what would you do basally\nyeah basically tearing it all up and\nreconstructing it all over talk about\nwidening or changing no anything no just\nstaying within the the same um why would\nwe need to tear them up instead of just\nrepave them it it depends if it needs um\nadditional work some of them are Beyond\nrepair and so yeah particularly in these\nareas thank you and just so you know as\na clarification in a followup to vice\nmayor lemon's question uh we do have in\nour upcoming budget um funds to redo\nsome of the fences and um walls that are\nwithin the Alleyways that are being\npaved this upcoming year so we have\nanother funding source that we're going\nto use for that additional Improvement\nexactly exactly okay yeah I'm just\ncurious for historical just education so\nyou need 50, ,000 residents to qualify\n50,000 or more right has has a city ever\nbeen lower than 50,000 residents to not\nqualify for this and if that were to\nhappen what would we do we would have to\ngo through the county so yeah to get\nthis money and and we we were at that\npoint too I think when I first started\nhere our our population was under under\n50 okay so the county runs those for the\nthe agency for for smaller C for smaller\ncities okay got it okay than you good\nquestion oh yes oh yes you may go ahead\nokay um I have a question my question is\num the senior programs does that include\nthe salary for the staff or an\nactivities or is it just\nactivities it includes just the salaries\nuh for the staff involved in running\nthese specific activities okay thank you\nall right is there a motion for this\nitem moved fam okay Miss loose may I\nhave a role I Council almost Council\nStallings yes vice mayor lemons yes\nmayor delado\nyes next is the award of contract for a\nnew rest for the new restrooms at Dills\nPark which are part of the Dills Park\nrenovation project Mr Marina will we\nhave a report please uh yes madame mayor\nabsolutely we've done and we are\nplanning to do several improvements at\nDills Park uh this is the latest Park\nImprovement at this site and as we\ncontinue to grow the amenities on the\n\nnorth side of the park there becomes\n\nactually more of a demand for a restroom\nfacility at that end of the park so we\ncurrently have a a porta potty out there\nbut we would like to replace this with\nmore of a permanent facility so with\nthat I'll turn it over to our community\nservices director Mr Dave Johnson who\nwill handle the atom Dave thank you John\nMayor and council members uh so before\nyou tonight um I wanted to just give you\na quick little background about what\nwe've done at Dills Park uh all the way\ngoing back to it said we finished the\nexpansion in 2009 but to let you know\n\nthe the effort to uh Target grants and\nto look at how to expand that that went\nall the way back to 1999 so it was\nactually a 10-year process to get that\nto happen uh but ultimately we were able\nto create a 2 and a half acre expansion\nof Dills Park um and we did renovate the\nentire park as part of that process uh\non the south end that's how we got that\nSouth Field those used to be uh there\nwere some dilapidated commercial\nproperties along Summerset and then we\ntook uh some homes along the uh south\nside of St Louis Street uh so that was a\nhuge project that we did for the Dills\nPark area and created really nice\namenities there uh we did then uh come\nback in 2020 uh using a grand from US\nsoccer and Target we created a mini\npitch field uh and I'll note that I my\nbullets are colorcoded because then it\nit corresponds with where they are on\nthe map at Dills Park um so on the North\nEnd of Dills Park we created that mini\npitch field um we're currently replacing\nthe playground on the North End or or in\nthe middle of the park\num you Council has already approved and\nthat project should start soon the Dills\nPark Orchard project will also be on the\nnorth side of Dills Park um and then we\nwhat we have for you tonight is the\nDills part of the Dills Park renovation\nDills Park renovation is in two parts\nthere's the new restroom facility and\nthen we'll be renovating the sou field\nand constructing a parking lot um so the\nSouthfield as you currently know that\nhas uh because of what was going on\nduring Co and we had a lot of outside\nadult and youth uh groups using that\nfield uh causing a lot of parking issues\nfor the neighborhood that's why those\nthose Boulders were put there as part of\nthis project that's going to allow us to\nremove those Boulders and it's going to\ncreate a project there that that's going\nto allow the community again to use that\nPark the way we had originally hoped and\nintended uh and it's finally get in a\nparking lot which is it's always needed\nand it's going to be very nice to have\nthat there um and then the landscape\nimprovements with the the Black Bullet\nuh that's not shown there it's going to\nbe over a 5year period for dealing with\nthat entire park uh it it's not it's\nlandscape improvements and irrigation\nthis is a 15-year-old project uh it does\nneed a little tender loving care to get\nit back to where it was with its native\nLandscaping uh so you'll see a lot of\nimprovements uh in the Landscaping side\nover the next 5 years and then we do\nhave in the 5year CIP plan to replace\nthe other playground on the south end of\nthe park uh so you'll see that happening\nhopefully soon in the next few years so\nthe Dills park has gotten a lot of\nattention uh it's a wonderful Park\nhumidity and so we want to keep uh it in\ngood shape and refining it uh so this\nspecific project uh the Dills Park\nrestroom um so as John mentioned you we\nhave a bathroom that was constructed\nwhen we renovated the park on the south\nend it's a very long Park uh and so\nthere's nothing really in the middle or\nnorth side of the of the park so this is\nfinally going to get us that restroom\nfacility that we need uh in the middle\nof the park that can serve that North\nEnd as well kids using the mini pitch uh\nbut more conveniently this bathroom as\nyou see from that second photo on the\nright that big red dot that's where the\nfacility will go so it's convenient\nbecause it will attach to the existing\nmaintenance room that has existing\nPlumbing so that makes it easier uh but\nit's right next to that playground where\nfolks bring their kids to play and\nthere'll be a convenient bathroom for\nthem to use um let's see and then\nobviously this is once this project gets\n\ngoing the other part of the project will\nbring to you next month or actually in\ntwo weeks uh that will approve the the\nrenovation of the Southfield Port\nportion uh we did uh publish bids back\non March 7th 2024 uh we did receive one\nbid uh when the bids were open on April\n16th our city engineer did review the\nbids and is recommending approval for\nthe 3M Construction Corporation um that\nwas the sole bid and they did qualify um\nand they submitted a bid in the amount\nof\n$3,975 and some\nchange uh so as we do uh we are adding a\n10% 10% contingency uh for our budget uh\nso it brings the total amount that we're\n\nbudgeting is to 235 372 and change\num and there was funding was already set\nup in the fiscal year 2324 Capital\nImprovement budget using measure a funds\nto complete this restroom portion of the\nproject we did budget $300,000 the bid\ncame in lower uh which we haven't seen\nthat happen a lot so this was very nice\nto see um so we're happy that we're able\nto approve this project if Council AG\nagrees uh the recommend action is to\napprove the contract for the Dills Park\nrestroom uh to 3M Construction\nCorporation I'd be happy to answer any\nquestions okay do my colleagues have any\ncomments or questions motion to\napprove definitely\nsecond okay so is there a motion for\nthis item yes ma'am I did it\nokay okay Miss loose may I have a roll\ncall please council member OS yes\ncouncil member qu Stallings yes vice\nmayor

presentation\nhappy to answer any\nquestions awesome I can't wait to dance\nlooking forward to it I don't know that\nI as much have a question as I do a\ncomment which is um I continue to get\ncomplaints that it's all Latin music\nespecially from the African-American\ncommunity and that they don't feel as\nrepresented and I mean it looks like\nit's what 10 to one or something here so\nI kind of have to side with them and I\nwould like to see more balance um in the\nmusic I know that that's the most\npopular and I accept that that's the\nmajority of our population but I think\nthat we have to be you know considerate\nto everyone and I'd like to see a more\nbalanced\nokay absolutely something we in the\nperformances yeah okay is there Madame\nmay you are we still thinking about I\nknow we did our our trial bases over at\nSpain Park I don't want to forget too\nthat I'm I know it was raining that day\nbut we did have a crowd out for the\nBunda so I'm not sure are we thinking\nabout taking that back out to Spain Park\nagain or just keeping everything at\nprogress no these would be just at\nProgress Park those are our popup\nmarkets which we actually do have one\ncoming up allamerican and something that\nwe're bringing to our city council and\nbudget will be two additional pop UPS\n\nthis new fiscal year still don't know\nthe location but so summer concerts are\nalways going to be at progress is that\nwhat we're that's kind of like\nsolidified done yeah that has been the\nhome and then along with the FMP which\nis our two summer fmps are actually\ncoming over here to the downtown can you\nremind me why we don't do them at\nParamount where there's more parking and\nI don't\nremember yeah um so the years that we\ntried at Pont Park um it doesn't have\nadequate shade and so it it was kind of\nhumorous where you had this this setup\nand everyone was sitting in a small\nsliver of shade they could find and so\nwe found out that when we moved to\nprogress there's better shade uh they\nhave a lot more opportuni so progress or\nParamount would be awesome if I had\nbetter shade to actually put 500 people\nin can you plant\ntrees we also we also found too that um\nthe way progresses park is located in\nthe neighborhood a lot of people walk\nthere Paramount Park's not really\nlocated near a neighborhood where people\ncan walk I mean the close one is Third\nStreet maybe they could walk but\nProgress Park is right in the middle of\nof a neighborhood so we do get people\nthat that walk over there too no I I get\nthat but I totally understand but like\nprogress I feels like on this side of\nthe the city we're still on and I think\nthat's the reason I'm council member\nalmost that we decided to go with the\n\npopups because we were here in our\nresidents right you're not doing\nanything in this side so moving our\npopup markets throughout the city I\nthink it's a great opportunity to hit\nthose neighborhoods for sure so we're\nstill doing pop-ups of music over there\nthat's fine yeah yes we sounds great\nokay is there a motion for this item I\nthink it's an or just a report just a\nreport Excuse me yes okay you're very\nwelcome thank you thank you next is an\noral report on the draft Park master\nplan Mr Moreno may we have a report\nplease uh yes madame mayor this is our\nlast item for the new business section\num we recently hired an experienced\nconsultant to draft what is known as a\npark master plan and you have your uh\ncopy of that right there in front of you\nmany cities have these types of plans um\nwhat the the parkm plan does it helps\nDefine a vision for our Parks and Rec\nfacilities and it also establishes\npriorities points out desires of what\nour Park facilities and amendments\nshould be um as you know we are a park\nstarved town uh mostly due to lack of\nopen space so developing a master plan\nlike this is even more vitally important\nto us so tonight our consultant will\nprovide you with an overview of what a\n\npark master plan is and what it attempts\nto do and he'll also explain you the\ntraditional path for adopting a park\nmaster plan and then what we'd like to\ndo is set up individual meetings with\nyou um at a future date so that you can\nmeet with the consultant and with our\nour staff to kind of explain what your\nvision would be for our park so with\nthat I'll turn it over to Mr Jose\nRodriguez of the firm Mig Consultants\nJose great thank you so much good\nevening honorable mayor Del and members\nof the city council uh my name is Jose\nRodriguez and I a senior project manager\nwith Mig and I was excited to work with\nuh City staff and preparing the public\nreview draft of the Parks and Recreation\nmaster plan uh as Mr Marino has\nmentioned uh there's a process that\nwe're going to re to introduce the the\nmaster plan uh we did present it to our\nuh Parks and Recreation Commission uh\nlast month and so uh we wanted to\npresent it uh to the city council and\nI'm going to provide a sort of an\noverview of the entire document I know\nyou have a copy of the document as well\nand then City staff through social media\nand other forms are going to make the\ndocument available so that we can\nreceive public comments before it moves\nforward towards adoption uh uh next\nmonth all right so the purpose of the\nmaster plan um you know uh Mr Johnson\nkind of started to mention uh earlier\nwhen he was looking at when looking at\nthe improvements of Dill Dill's Park and\nthe Parks and Recreation master plan is\nlooks at the entire city uh holistically\nin terms of parks the park system where\nthe parks are located the size of the\nparks and the amenities what the parks\nmaster plan does is provide a 10-year\nplan uh uh on how to how the city can\nlook to improve existing Parks uh but\nyou know if population grows how to grow\nthe park system as well and and a lot of\nthe things that the park master plan\ndoes is look at some of the challenges\nbut it creates a long-term Vision a\n10year vision uh for the parks uh in the\ncity uh and it takes a lot of it looks\nat a lot of the uh existing conditions\nand then makes recommendations\nrecommendations for the existing Parks\nuh as well as how to expand uh Park\n\nopportunities uh within the\ncity uh another key part is community\nengagement there was Community\nengagement done for the Parks and\nRecreation master plan and we took a lot\nof that public input to help create that\nvision and and guide some of the\nrecommendations one of the key things\nthat the the parks master plan\nrecognizes is that parmount is a built\nout City uh there's not all this\navailable vacant land to just build\nbuild Parks um so it looks at different\nopportunities unique opportunities where\nto expand but that's going to be part of\nthe challenge uh and there the the\nmaster plan does make some\nrecommendations on expanding Parks uh\nbut there's there's definitely uh\ndifferent opportunities to look at how\nto assess uh that expansion and a lot of\nit of course is going to have to be\ndealt with uh funding uh Park expansion\nwhere to get that additional money and\nthen the land\nitself all right wrot briefly on the\n\ncommunity engagement we did uh we did a\nhandful of popup events uh we did uh a\nsurvey uh and we got almost uh 300\nresponses and these are the key kind of\noverview comments that we received from\nfrom the popup events and the survey\nobviously more Parks and Recreation uh\nspaces is\nneeded more sports facilities\nparticularly soccer was one of the\nthings that we heard both from the\npublic in general and also through some\nstakeholder interviews uh we we spoke\nwith some some of the uh uh uh Sports uh\nsport sports leagues uh and and\ndefinitely more sports facilities uh\nmore programs for all ages uh\nImprovement to existing Parks uh where\nwhere existing Parks can be improved\noptimization of existing Parks how to\nimprove the existing Parks you have now\nbut fully you know efficiently use the\nexisting land that's available uh more\naccessibility for different uh for those\n\nwho have different abilities uh safety\nand M maintenance was also one of the\nbig uh topic areas uh that we heard from\nthe public and then how how do we find\nmore Creative Solutions uh for uh\naddressing the lack of park space and\nthen one thing we did actually hear a\nlot from the community is just the pre\nappreciation of the parks themselves The\nParks programs and so forth we did hear\na lot uh from our community um uh\n\nengagement existing conditions so when\nwe do a Parks master plan we do create\nWhat's called the Baseline condition uh\nrecognize where are all the parks are\nlocated the facilities that are there we\ndo this big inventory that identifies\nthe number of ball fields uh because\nwhat we start to do is recognize the\nlevel of service based on existing\npopulation how many acres what type of\nFields uh where they're located and so\nforth so we get we did our Baseline\nconditions through that and through the\nuh public engagement we started to\nrecognize what was the long-term Vision\nwhat's what's the long-term vision for\nthe Parks and Recreation master plan and\na lot of this we we do that from the\nengagement part talking with staff\ntalking with the the the community uh\nsome of the key things that we heard and\nthat we've I recognize as the master\nplan goals was creating more Equitable\naccess to parks in Green Space\nuh diversifying the recreation\namenities uh making sure that the park\nuh that are they're wellmaintained and\nsustainable over the long term uh\ncreating a park system that Fosters\nHealth wellness and safety uh through\nthe programs and then Partnerships uh\nthat's one of the key recommendations\nyou'll see uh through some of the\nstrategies is again looking at more\nPartnerships uh and as well as other\ninvestment opportunities again to\nstrengthen your exist Parks\nplan once we do once we identify the\nvision we've did our background report\nwe start looking at the needs assessment\nand the needs assessment really\n\nrecognizes where those needs and gaps\nare uh both on park access uh we do a\naccess analysis to show where uh all of\nthe parks and residential areas that are\nwithin a 10-minute walk of a park and\nthen we start to see where some of those\nGap areas where where within existing\nresidential areas are not not within a\n10-minute walk within a park um so this\nmap kind of helps identifies that um but\nwe also look at the facilities that are\nexisting in Paramount uh the sports\nFields the courts uh we look at the\nnumber and where they are also\ndistributed geographically throughout\nthe city and so we start to make some\nanalysis in addition to the needs\nassessment we also look at what's called\nthe level of service as as I mention the\nnumber of acres per thousand uh\nresidents and we do some comparisons\nwith some\nuh national uh standards to see where\nParamount uh\nFalls once we start doing our analysis\nexisting conditions we get public input\nuh we do our needs assessment then we\nlook and start to look at\nrecommendations recommendations are done\nin two parts one is we do a series of or\nwe do what's called systemwide\nrecommendations these are the highlevel\nrecommendations but in the plan you'll\nsee there's specifically uh uh items\nthat that uh fall under those uh\nStatewide recommendations increasing\nParkland uh more Sports and active\nRecreation facilities uh expanded\namenities and Phil facilities\nImprovement of existing sites um\naccessibility for all users and then\nsafety and maintenance and so there's\nsome specific recommendations and again\n\nthese are\nCitywide uh uh recommendations excuse\nme then if you look at the plan there's\nalso a series of site specific\nrecommendations every single part Park\nuh has a series of\nrecommendations uh reflecting some of\nthose uh Citywide or Park wide uh\nsystemwide recommendations as well uh we\nhave a summary map that shows where\nthose improvements are and we recognize\nCity staff's been working hard with a\nlot of improvements you heard a little\nbit about Dills Park but there's been\nnew playgrounds that have opened up um\nand so we've taken that into account\ninto uh the parks master plan\nrecognizing there's still a lot of\nimprovements uh and proposed\nimprovements that are on uh\nupcoming second to the last part is the\nopportunities and I get this is where I\nwant to emphasize some of the challenges\nuh that the park and Parks master plan\nhas identified is how do we\nexpand uh park space and so in within\nthe within the document there's a series\nof recommendations uh and opportunity\nsites uh that the plan recognizes there\nthere's some available uh sites that\ncould uh uh be redeveloped to Parks but\na lot of it has to do with either\npurchasing property which as you know is\nvery\nexpensive Edison lines I know there's a\npark that's been built on Addison lines\nbut just recently and this is not just\naffecting Paramount but all the\n\nsurrounding uh communities uh that are\nthat are within the Edison area is that\nthey changed their policy on long-term\nleases they're no no longer providing\nlong-term leases which is really limited\num a lot of cities that looking at\nEdison's for expensive Capital\nImprovements within Edison RightWay\nlands so maybe there's uh there's some\nrecommendations to maybe more lighter\ntouches or less expensive improvements\nsuch as Trails um and so forth other uh\nsites that we looked at as opportunities\nuh there's a big Matrix in the document\nthat rates and assesses them so like\nsome of them are yeah this is a great\nopportunity we look at different\nassessment categories um and then other\n\nones um there there's just challenges uh\nwe looked at the opportunities but again\nlet cost of land or working with that\nparticular jurisdiction might be a\nchallenge so we looked at use of\npotential uh Redevelopment of properties\n\nuh the utility cor Corridor leases as I\nmentioned partnership with institutions\nthat's one we definitely looked at\nclosely the city already does joint use\nagreements with uh the school districts\nuh and provide some of the Parkland\nparticularly soccer fields and some of\nthe the sports Fields uh so the joint\nuse agreements allows the city to\ncontinue to use those Parks how to maybe\npossibly expand those not necessarily\nwith school districts but maybe some\nother Partnerships as well uh so the\ngoal of the specific of the master plan\n\nis really to look specifically at all\ntypes of opportunities and we know\nthat's going to be the challenge of\nexpanding uh Parklands and as I\nmentioned there's a matrix that again\nassesses all of those including\nTrails uh particularly the one that's uh\nproposed uh along the the rail line for\nuh future rail uh light rail um so\npotential some opportunities there as\nwell but each opportunity again is rated\non what type of uses or Park uses could\nbe applied and then what how feasible is\nit actually to apply\nthose and then the last part of the\nparks master plan is the implementation\npart and this is going to really help\nstaff particularly when they need to\nassess opportunities that may come up um\nand bring forth uh uh to implementing uh\nbut we have Capital cost assumptions uh\n\nthere's a table that lists all the\ndifferent uh kind of up-to-date cost on\nif they were to add uh a small Park what\nare some of the amenities and then the\ncost associated with it we have some PRI\nprioritization criteria again if you're\nlooking at an opportunity that comes up\nthere's a checklist that says well what\ndoes this par Park area provide uh how\ndoes that uh you know what are the some\nof the benefits the uh cost benefit\nanalysis that can be made and whether\nit's worth pursuing doing so that helps\nuh City\nstaff City staff again has also has done\na great job in bringing in a lot of\nGrants to help pay for Park improvements\nand then again we looked at those\nopportunities as well and make sure we\nlisted those and as well as maybe some\nother opportunities that might might be\navailable in addition to building parks\nand paying for all amenities there's\n\nalso maintenance and operation costs\nthat are associated so we have some\nassumptions on what that typically costs\non a per acre uh\nvalue uh how uh land acquisition\nmechanisms and then partnership\nprotocols again working with different\nuh districts uh the school districts and\nso forth on on opportunities again to\nutilize some of their\nland this is the example of the capital\nproject prioritization uh criteria so\n\nyou can check mark where that particular\nopportunity uh provides um uh those\nimprovements and\nbenefits so that is uh kind of to\nprovide you an overview of the Parks and\nRecreation master plan we're excited\nbecause this is actually the first Parks\nand Recreation master plan that the city\nhas prepared um and I'm here as well as\nstaff to answer any questions uh but\nthis is kind of our roll out continuing\nroll out of our public engagement and we\nwant the public now to take a look at\nthis and provide comments and so when we\nbring that back we're going to provide\nrecommended changes or comments we hear\nfrom the public uh before it gets\nadopted so I'm happy to answer any\nquestions questions okay Do my\ncolleagues have any comments or\nquestions I just have one really quickly\non this page so are those the prior you\nhave them counted as one through five is\nthat the priority or just you just have\nit numbered one through five those are\nthe one through five key goals goal okay\nkey goals and then under each goal if\nyou go further down the pages we'll have\nsome uh guiding strategies for each of\nthose goals each goals that provides a\nlittle bit more detailed those are the\nhigh level goals that help uh what are\n\nthe things that we heard that the master\nplan tries to address\nokay okay well thank you so much Mr\nRodriguez Mad May if I may I'm sorry yes\nwe do have a comment card uh that was\n\nemailed to us um today about this item\nso I'll turn it over to miss loose who\n\nwill read\nthis thank you Mr\nMareno the comment is from Alejandro\njannes good afternoon as you all know I\nwe have been advocating to have our\nhistorical handball courts rebuilt in\nthis city handball was a part of\nParamount before the city was\nincorporated built by LA County as a\nhistory Paramount was once a thriving\nrecreational sporting City growing up\nhere as I have I recall in 1988\nParamount was recognized as an\nAll-American City that year and a couple\nof years to follow our Paramount High\nSchool boys football won back to back\nthe soccer team won the wrestling team\nwon baseball pja AA was heavily\nparticipated and one of the goto\nactivities we had endless choices of\nrecreation for residents that\nparticipated to participate in boxing\nwhich was a very popular sport in a 93%\nMexican Community is now gone men's\nadult soccer was removed men's adult\nsoftball was removed handball was the\nlast remaining outdoor male dominated\nsport left City removed all our choices\nfor male adult recreation in response\nCity mentioned futa which to this day\nhas failed and failed miserably and has\nnowhere near the interest hball had in\nthe\ncity systematically discrim discriminate\nagainst all male\nSports there for removing adult males to\ngather and socialize footall failed so\nmiserably that the city parks and\nrecreation one year use City funds to\npurchase frozen turkeys and promote\nfrozen turkey bow in at the foota courts\nthat was a pathetic and wasteful use of\nour city funds ever since our choice of\nrecreation has been removed there's been\nvery low participation in Recreation as\na majority of residents choose chose to\nleave Paramount and seek Recreation\nwhere city leaders do not Place Boulders\nin our open space limited City example\nDale's Park that concludes the comment\nMadam mayor okay thank you Miss loose\nnow we'll move on now it is time for\nCouncil Members reports and we'll begin\nwith vice mayor\nlemons thank you Madame\nmayor um I attended our National Day of\nPrayer and would like to say another\nthank you to the pastors and all the\nguests who offered up prayers on behalf\nof our city and all segments of our\ncommunity also attended the children's\nbenefit dinner by the Community Family\nGuidance Center uh which is of of course\nan an organization that the city\nsupports and provides services to our\nchildren and I hope that they raised\n\nlots of money um I attended our\nlandscape media meeting and I believe um\nat our next council meeting we'll be\nbringing to you some of the fruits of\nour labor that um council member um quar\nStallings and myself are part of that\ncommittee and have been working really\nhard to select the right designs and the\nright plans to we're going to have some\nbeautiful medians in town and I attended\nour homeless ad hoc committee with a\ncouncil member almost and we have some\nchanges coming our way that we have to\nadapt to and um we of course had some\nphenomenal reports from Public Safety\nfrom Maggie and Steve about the great\n\njob that they're doing with our homeless\npopulation thank you madam mayor thank\nyou council member\nAlmos Peggy thank you for giving my\nreport I appreciate that um I just want\nso since you were able to cover all the\nevents um I just want to couple comments\nI wanted to make just to remind the\ncommunity about our 5K 1K coming on June\n1st so super excited about that so we\nhave Team oldal coming out not sure if\nI'm going to run it but may walk it um\nthe other thing is uh quick questions so\nis footall not soccer and soccer not\nfootall is that considered the same in\ndefinition it's it's still soccer it it\ndoes it uses a round soccer like ball uh\nit's played on a hard surface on a\nsmaller space uh so yeah it's it's\nintended for uh you know like five on\nfive seven on seven so when when the\nresidents were asking that they wanted\nmore soccer was it soccer or footall or\nwas it just they just know the\ndifference well it's called a footall\ncourt but it's it's soccer so when you\ngo if you go to p park if you go to\n\nDills Park where the mini pitches you\nwill see people playing soccer soccer\nokay that's I just wanted confirmation\non that and then let me ask for when we\ntalk about ADA compliance I know you\n\nsaid it's not in our permit process\nright but when they're building when\nyou're building a a new building right\nthey go in and they measure to make sure\nthat there's wheelchair access for the\nbathroom doorways and stuff but when\nit's an existing building we never we\ndon't check right when they're coming\nfor a business license I just I'm trying\nto understand that am I right on that\nit's just for a building that they're\nchecking for ADA compliance well you're\nright so I think we should keep in mind\nthat the American with Disabilities Act\nit was into law by George Bush so in the\nN '90s\nso it's very recent and think about it\nso it's easy when you're building\nsomething when you're maybe a newer town\nwith space to build new buildings but\nwhen you you're in a built out city with\nolder buildings like this it's just very\nit's difficult so we we um as um\nbusiness owners and or Property Owners\ncome in for for permits yes those kind\ntypes of regulations are are\nenforced but um yeah it's it's just\nreally hard as as businesses transition\nfrom one to the other that's where um\nyeah there it's not uncommon for\nbusiness for cities with um buildings as\nat the age of paramounts to have this\nkind of issue so yes we could U the\nplanning department will work with the\nfinance department on um maybe I was\nthinking like a maybe a supplemental\nkind of inform information that we could\num we could add yeah okay thank you\nthat's all I have Madam mayor okay thank\nyou um council member Stallings yes I\nhave similar um events that I attended I\ndid

creature, and whereas the state of Florida water management districts and the city of Winter Garden are working together to increase awareness about the importance of water conservation.\nAnd whereas the city of Winter Garden in the state of Florida has designated April typically a dry month when water demands are most acute, Florida Water Conservation Month, to educate citizens about how they can help save Florida's precious water resources and whereas the city of Winter Garden has always encouraged and supported water conservation through various educational programs and special events, and whereas every business, industry, school and citizen can make a difference when it comes to conserving water, thus promoting a healthy economy and community and whereas outdoor irrigation compromises a large portion of water use, the city of Winter Garden will encourage citizens and businesses to focus on improving outdoor irrigation efficiency.\nTherefore, it is my great pleasure and privilege as the mayor of the city of Winter Garden, to proclaim the month of April 2024 as Fortis Water Conservation Month and call upon the residents and businesses of Winter Garden to do their share to protect this precious resource by practicing water saving measures and becoming more aware of the need to save water.\nFor this, the 26th year of Water Conservation Month, there will be a special focus on improving outdoor irrigation efficiencies.\nDonna?\nDonna, did you have anything you wanted to say?\nOkay.\nOkay.\nNext we will go down and do a proclamation.\nProclamation 240 three whereas autism spectrum disorders are a broad range of conditions characterized by many patterns of behavior and challenges with social skills, speech, and nonverbal communication and whereas, autism spectrum disorders affect at least one in 36 children and a number of adults in the United States of all genders, races, ethnicities and socioeconomic patterns and whereas, early accurate diagnosis and appropriate education, intervention and support provider to the well being of those with autism spectrum disorder and whereas, persons with an autism spectrum disorder can have access to their care, services and opportunities to be happy and achieve the greatest potential and whereas, the city of Winter Garden is honored to take part in the annual observance of World Autism Month and World Autism Awareness Day with the hope that it will lead to more research and better understanding and acceptance of autism spectrum disorder.\nTherefore, it is my great pleasure and privilege as a mayor of the City of Winter Garden to surf on April 2024 as World Autism Month and April 2, 2024 as World Autism Awareness Day in one regard to risk, public acceptance and understanding of autism spectrum disorder, as well as increased knowledge of the efforts that have been and are being made to support individuals with autism spectrum disorder and their families.\nThank you, mayor.\nWe've been together doing this for many, many years.\nAll right, Victor, stay right there.\nDiagnosed with autism over 15 years ago, Victor Wright has overcome many obstacles.\nVictor started swimming when he

more fun and rewarding things, our 2024 drop savers posters contest.\nAnd winners.\nYes, ma'am.\nWill the students and the teachers for the Dropsavers poster contest please come up here and join me?\nPlease?\nAnd while they're coming up here, I'll tell you a little bit about the contest.\nEvery year, the Florida section of the American Waterworks association sponsors the Dropsavers poster contest.\nStudents in grades kindergarten through 12th grade are encouraged to create a poster depicting a water conservation idea in slogan form, drawing form, or both.\nThe contest allows students to promote water awareness and learn about the importance of water conservation in their daily lives.\nThis year, 72 students participated from four schools, Star Child Academy, West Orange High School Foundation Academy, and one homeschool group.\nA panel of judges selected posters based on the following criteria.\nMessage, creativity, originality, and not just artistic ability.\nAll right, our first winner in division one, who is a kindergartner, right.\nMiss Farah Martinez.\nThanks for participating.\nDo you want to go over there and point to your poster.\nAll right.\nOur next division winner is wreth Tocas.\nAnd this is a division two winner.\nCongratulations.\nNo.\nYes.\nPlease point to your poster.\nAnd our division three winner is layla Thompson.\nThank you.\nCongratulations.\nAnd will you go point to your.\nAll right.\nOur division four winner is the middle school winner.\nAnd this year goes to Shiloh Hillis.\nCongratulations.\nWill you point to your poster?\nTwo.\nAll right.\nAnd our high school winner is Kayla Bolivar from foundation Academy.\nAnd is she not?\nOkay, so, will you accept?\nAnd then you get to point to her poster.\nOkay.\nWe

now we gotta get serious.\nYeah, they went the fun time.\nOkay.\nA lot of talented people here in one regard.\nAnd we appreciate it.\nIt's fun to see the young ones.\nNext is our world risk.\nWorld risk management relating to named Windstorm coverage.\nMister mayor.\nYes, sir, Mister Holland.\nMister mayor.\nJust a brief introduction to Josh Allen.\nHe's vice president with world risk management is here to talk about named Windstorm coverage.\nAnd just to kind of share with you how my timing is impeccable.\nA little over a week ago, right after we decided to put this item on the agenda, Colorado State University released their hurricane predictions for this year, which is supposed to be one of the worst ever.\nBut all joking aside, Josh is here to present an idea about windstorm coverage and moving us to a different level of coverage with some savings.\nBefore he begins, I will tell you that staff consisting of myself, Frank, Sherrill, Kim, and Laura have all met with Josh on a couple of different occasions to vet this out.\nI think it's safe to say that we are supportive, but we felt like that this was an important enough decision that we needed to bring it back to you, to let you have an opportunity to hear what they're saying, to also ask any questions that you may have.\nAnd if you decide to give us authorization to proceed, we're okay with that.\nAnd if you decide at the end of the day, that's not something you want to do at the moment, we're okay with that as well.\nSo with that.\nYes, sir.\nThank you very much for the introduction.\nNo pressure after, you know, verbalizing what the hurricane outlook looks for this year, but.\nMister mayor, esteemed commissioners, good evening.\nMy name is Joshua Howlin.\nI'm here today representing public risk management of Florida, also known as PRM, which is the city's current property casualty insurer.\nAs you guys are probably well aware, the property insurance market in the state of Florida.\nFlorida has seen its fair share of challenges has seen its fair share of challenges over the last.\nOver the last year.\nOver the last several years.\nAnd quite frankly, last year was probably the tipping point in terms of how much the market has hardened and how much costs have gone up and how much limits have been restricted in terms of the amount of coverage that's available to everyone in the state of Florida, and that's just governmental entities.\nSo towards that end, what we've, what we do and what we've done every single year is look for creative ways, or creative solutions, if you will, to try to not only enhance the coverage for the city and all the participating members of PRM, but as well offset some of those rising costs of insurance.\nAnd so what we did this past year was we went out to and did a full marketing exercise to explore a second tower for PRM.\nAnd so what that basically means is we went through a competitive bid process where we solicited, you know, no less than, you know, two dozen property insurance carriers out in the marketplace to try to create the second tower to provide enhanced coverage and reduce costs for, not just for the city, but for some of the participating members of PRM as well.\nAnd so where we landed was this second tower carries with it a name storm limit of $50 million.\nAnd our suggestion, our recommendation to the city was to move into this tower.\nNow, I know it seems a little wonky because the existing coverage for the city has an 80 million name Windstorm coverage limit.\nHowever, that first tower is shared among 70 members throughout the state of Florida.\nThis second tower is only shared with four other members, or rather with three other members.\nWinter Garden would be the fourth participating member.\nSo just in terms of simple math, you have 80 million name storm coverage on the other tower, shared among 70.\nThat's a little over a million dollars worth of coverage for each of those participating members in the second tower.\nYou would be sharing it with three others.\nSo you'd have basically a share of twelve and a half million.\nI think the 50 million, again, with the reduction in coverage, I think that becomes a moot point anyways, because as we go strategically adding different accounts into the second tower, that 50 million name windstorm limit is going to increase anyways.\nAnd so it's a not, it should be a, it should be a non factor in terms of how this program models and whether or not, you know, the city is actually getting a reduction in coverage.\nAgain, from a practical perspective, I think the city would actually be, would have more available limit to it in the event that a storm actually, you know, hit this area and impacted you significantly.\nWith that said, you know, that's pretty much the gist of it.\nWe've gone over it in pretty, in a lot of detail with staff to make sure that they had come, you know, comfort with what we were recommending and to make sure that we had buy in from them.\nIn terms of what, you know, what does this mean for the city if you were to make this change?\nAnd what is PRM doing?\nAs for consideration for the city contemplating making this change, is that we are agreeing or committing to a 10% reduction on the rate of insurance for the city for the upcoming renewal on October 1, which is kind of unheard of this year, this early in the game, with hurricane season right around the corner, the fact that, you know, PRM is willing to commit to a 10% rate of insurance reduction, that will obviously have, you know, an impact on the city's budget moving forward.\nSo you'll see a reduction come ten one, and like I said, you'll have more available limit to you for the upcoming year as well.\nThe 10% in dollars is.\nYeah, so great question.\nSo in terms of dollars, it's difficult to give you an exact answer.\nI understand that, but I like some type of estimate.\nI mean, I think it basically amounts to probably a little over 100, 125, $150,000 in savings for the city.\nAnd the reason why it's spread out is because what is used as a basis for rating is going to be your total insurable values.\nAnd so your exposures have gone up around 6%.\nSo depending on whether or not there's any additional additions or deletions from the schedule, that number can fluctuate.\nBut irrespective of that, ultimately the rate of insurance, since it will go down 10%, that gets extrapolated out based off total insurable value that the city had, and that will reflect in the savings come October 1.\nSo we're basically going from 1.1 million coverage, in essence, to twelve and a half million.\nWell, I mean, in simple math.\nYes, in simple math.\nRight.\nThat's what I think.\nWith that, there's a reduction of somewhere between 101 hundred, 25,000, let's just say on that.\nAnd as we go forward, then as more cities come into this, you expect then the 50 million to go up in proportionate, or that twelve and a half is going to start dropping?\nNo, that is correct.\nSo we do expect, we do expect to increase the name windstorm coverage.\nAs other, as other entities enter this second tower.\nOur goal obviously would, would be to continue.\nSo there's, and I was purposely, I should say, not addressing the modeling component that's associated with named Windstorm coverage only because it gets, it gets a little convoluted.\nIt's very nuanced.\nRight.\nBut basically every, every property carrier out there uses modeling to determine what the appropriate limits to buy are.\nAnd so they buy to certain return periods, which means that there's a percentage of probability that you'll hit this probable maximum loss.\nSo the second tower buys 50 million, which is a thousand year event, which means that there's a 0.1% chance that you'll ever hit that limit.\nAnd so what we'll do is as new members enter the second tower, we'll make sure that we continue to buy to the appropriate event level to make sure that there's enough coverage for all participating members.\nI remember in 1989, though, Duke Crittenden saying we had 3100 year freezes in the eighties, so we were good for the next 300 years.\nSo, you know, you don't know.\nBut if we want to go back from, for whatever reason, from tower two, tower one, the city have the capability of doing that.\nYeah.\nSo short answer is yes.\nLonger answer is a little bit more.\nThe longer range, you can take it up with staff.\nYeah.\nYes.\nYes.\nOkay.\nAny yes.\nJosh, if you wouldn't mind, would you talk about how geographically spread the entities in tower two?\nYeah, so there are, like I said, four entities.\nOne is in central Florida, one is going to be dead smack in the middle of Florida, which is going to be Alachua, and then we have one over on the west coast, and then one on the southwest coast.\nSo the geographical spread of risk is good, which is why we're able to buy the limits that we're buying in this particular tower, and, quite frankly, why we're able to pass off these savings to the city of kindergarten.\nOkay, so let me piggyback off what the mayor asked.\nThis was a really good question then, multi part.\nSo what control do we have over other entities entering into tower two?\nYeah, I think that's a fair question.\nSo I think this is the difference with just the PRM program in general.\nSo PRM is governed by a board of directors that meets quarterly, and so they get to decide on the different initiatives and different things that go into the PRM program.\nI think traditionally, when you're talking about whether or not you have an option to choose which program you're going to go into, or which tower you're going to go into, that's non existent with other competing pools with other programs.\nOne of the reasons why we brought this recommendation to the city of Winter Garden, we didn't just move you guys into this second tower, although we feel pretty confident that this is the best move for you guys, not just now, but moving forward in terms of being able to get the appropriate amount of coverage, enhanced coverages, as well as reduce your costs, we're always open to having those conversations.\nOkay, that drives that.\nSo, yeah, I'd have to see more of the data at the end, but the other part of that then, of course, is that as other entities enter in, referenced earlier, diluting the potential payout of that or coverage.\nSo want to better understand what impact that has, because without out of ignorance, I don't know where tower one started.\nDid it have 80 participants in the beginning or 70%?\nSure.\nDid it grow to that?\nAnd we started to get diluted.\nSo, historically, looking at that, yeah.\nSo terra one started with eight founding members just to put it out there.\nSo it's grown into 70 members over the course of 30 plus years.\nI think what's happened in the property market over the last couple years has caused us to pivot a little bit in terms how we look at the property placement.\nSo before, where the cost of insurance, particularly at those upper levels, meaning the excess levels, wasn't as high as it is today, where today excess costs are almost as expensive as the primary, as a primary layer of insurance.\nFor that reason, we felt that it was necessary to kind of diversify and spread that risk a little bit more horizontally versus vertical, just because the cost of insurance has gone up exponentially over the last couple years.\nRight.\nIn terms of where tower one stands today, I think in general, all programs, all standalone placements, they're probably purchasing between like 100 and 250 year event, which is basically a one to .4% chance that, you know, that you'll hit that probable maximum limit.\nAnd so tower one is no different.\nIt's purchasing between the 100 and the 250 year event.\nTower two is purchasing up to the thousand year event, which suggests, obviously, that there's going to be more available limit in the event of a really bad storm for the city.\nNow, as we go adding members to it again, I think, you know, the fact that there is less name Windstorm coverage in that tower, it becomes a mood issue because we will adjust the name Windstorm limit accordingly.\nAnd further, PRM is committed to make sure that anybody that goes into the second tower, that we're running all the appropriate modeling, determining how it's going to impact, the probable maximum loss, and that we're not just going to stuff this tower full of, for lack of a better way of saying it, garbage.\nOkay, so that was going to be my last question then, is, from a risk mitigation standpoint, the introduction of other municipalities that are on the coast, which have a higher probability of damage and cost.\nYeah, you know, that seems to be the, you know, the kind of the mindset for everyone.\nBut, you know, typically when we look at the storms and the claims, it never seems to fair that way.\nLike, city of key west, for example, models horribly, but they hardly ever have, like, significant damage.\nSo I, you know, they're built like a tank down there.\nYeah, that's true also.\nI mean, look, we rely on the modeling, but it's not the end all, be all.\nThere's an element of common sense that goes into this.\nAnd I think as we go adding members, PRM one has always been very strategic in terms of who we bring onto the pool.\nSo, you know, we're going to be very cautious about adding coastal properties.\nWe're going to be very cautious in terms of the size of entities that we add.\nWe're going to make sure that obviously, it models well that we're buying to the appropriate limits and that we can continue to pass those cost savings on to, you know, the participating members.\nThank you.\nAny other questions?\nYes, Josh, if I remember correctly, in evaluating members going into tower two, one of the factors that you're going to look at is making sure that geographical spread is maintained.\nOkay.\nJust remember that one for the record.\nThat's correct.\nYeah, that'd be good.\nOkay.\nWe need a motion.\nSo moved.\nWe have a motion to approve.\nDo we have a second?\nA second.\nWe have a motion.\nWe have a second.\nAll in favor, signify by saying aye.\nAye.\nOpposed?\nMotion carries unanimously.\nThank you, sir.\nThank you very much.\nAppreciate it.\nNext we'll go to first reading and public hearing of proposed ordinances.\nOrdinance 20 411.\nYes, sir.\nOrdinance 20 411, an ordinance of the city of Winter Garden, Florida, amending the future land use map of the winter garden comprehensive plan by changing the land use designation of real property, generally described as a approximately 0.26 plus minus acres, located at 114 East Cypress street, east of Dillard street, west of Winter street, north of East Palmetto street, and south of East Story Road from low density residential to commercial, providing for severability, providing for an effective date.\nThank you.\nYes, ma'am.\nThank you, mayor and commissioners, and welcome, Chloe.\nThis is a request for future land use amendment and rezoning of a property located at 114 East Cypress street.\nThe total property size is 0.52 acres but currently has split zoning.\nThe western 0.26 acres is zoned c two and has a commercial future land use designation and the eastern 26 acres is zoned two reals and has a low density residential future land use designation.\nThe reason the parcel has a split zoning is that the owner purchased a portion of the Calvary Baptist Church's lot to the east and it was subsequently combined by ownership.\nThe applicant is requesting to rezone the eastern 0.26 acres to c two and change the future land use to commercial to make it consistent with the balance of the property.\nAfter adoption of these ordinances, the applicant will continue to seek site plan approval to build a commercial building on the property, which will require a separate commission approval of the proposed plans and building elevations.\nStaff has reviewed the application and recommends approval of ordinances 20 411 and 20 412.\nWe're going to.\nHe only read 20 411, so we'll do 20 411.\nThen we'll come 20, 412.\nQuestion that.\nAny questions from the commission?\nLet me start.\nI just kind of want to understand why we want to take a residential and turn it into a commercial.\nI know that house has been there since it's 114 years old.\n1910.\nYeah.\n114 years.\nThat house is.\nYeah, it was.\nAccording to the property appraiser, it was built in 2010.\nUnfortunately, it's not protected by the National Register of Historic Places.\nIt's not within a zoning overlay that would provide an extra layer of protection.\nSo the city has very limited ability to prevent any demolition of that property.\nHeritage?\nNobody wants it?\nUnfortunately, no.\nI will reach out to the heritage in case they want to document the structure before it's demolished, take pictures, get any information they can.\nThey've done that with other.\nOther properties that have been demolished downtown.\nSo giving us the residential side.\nWhere I was going with this is even though he did purchase some extra property, does it really make sense to intrude more commercial development into the residential?\nSo that particular location, it doesn't really have a lot of residential around it.\nYou have a gas station to the west.\nYou have a commercial to the south, the bowling alley.\nYou have a church property to the north, which is nothing strictly residential.\nAnd they're actually taking a piece of the church property and to their east as a storage facility for the church operations.\nSo in this particular location, there's really no encroachment into any truly residential properties.\nOkay, this is a public hearing.\nWe will open a public hearing.\nIf anyone wishes to speak.\nSeeing none, we will close the public hearing.\nWe need a motion.\nMotion to approve ordinance 20 411.\nWe have a motion to approve.\nDo we have a second?\n2nd.\nWe have a motion.\nWe have a second.\nAny other discussion?\nAll in favor, signify by saying aye.\nOpposed?\nMotion carried unanimously.\nOrdinance 20 412.\nYes, sir.\nOrdinance 20 412, an ordinance of the city of Winter Garden, Florida, rezoning approximately 0.26 plus minus acres, located at 114 East Cypress street, east of Dillard street, west of Winter street, north of East Palmetto street, and south of East Story Road.\nFrom r two residential district to c two arterial commercial district.\nProviding for severability, providing for an effective date.\nThank you.\nStaff recommends approval of ordinance 20 412.\nAny other questions?\nI don't know what shape.\nI haven't paid that close attention what shape the house is really in now.\nI think used for the cavalry for a while.\nYeah.\nIt's an old wood frame structure and definitely has seen better days.\nYeah, it was old when I went to school across the street.\nI'm sorry.\nWhat was that?\nIt was old?\nWhen I went to school across the street.\nOh, yeah, it's been 1910.\nGood lord, forever.\nYou're not that old.\nAny questions?\nCommission?\nOnce again, this is a public hearing.\nWe will open a public hearing.\nIf anyone wishes to speak, we will close the public hearing and we need a motion.\nMove to approve.\nWe have a motion to approve.\nWe have a second.\n2nd motion.\nA second.\nAll in favor, signify by saying aye.\nAye.\nAye.\nOpposed?\nMotion carries unanimously.\nResolution 240 eight.\nYes, sir.\nResolution 240 eight.\nA resolution of the city of Winter Garden, Florida, amending ordinance 19 28 20, establishing the PCD ordinance on certain real property, generally described as approximately 3.70 plus minus acres of land, generally located at 1061, 1063, and 1065 Tildeville School Road on the southeast corner of Tildeville School Road and the West Orange Trail.\nApproving a minor amendment to extend the PCD for three additional years, providing for severability, providing for an effective.\nThank you.\nYes, ma'am.\nThank you.\nThis resolution is for the old packing house property located at 1061, 1063 and 1065 Tildeville School Road.\nThe PCD rezoning ordinance was originally approved in 2019.\nShortly thereafter, as I'm sure you all remember, came inflation, expanding construction costs, etcetera.\nSo the project was put on hold temporarily, and the PCD expired in the interim time.\nThe applicant recently requested that the city adopt a resolution to amend the property's PCD ordinance, 1920, to extend the PCD for three additional years.\nAll of the requirements of the ordinance will remain as previously approved.\nSo with that, staff recommends approval of resolution 240 eight.\nIs he still trying to do what his original concept was?\nYes, he'd still be beholden to carrying out that original concept.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nQuestions from the commission.\nI got one change.\nBefore I do, a question from the owner there.\nIs he permitted to continue having rv storage there?\nIs that allowable right now in the PCD?\nYou asked me that question earlier.\nYeah, there's a time limit put on that PCD for all the existing uses.\nAnd I told him we just have to go back and really parse the ordinance to see what he would be allowed to do on a temporary basis while he's constructing the new facility.\nSo we'll have those conversations.\nYeah, I know that.\nMay I answer your other question, too?\nI think next month he wants to start the.\nStart the sewer system connections and stuff.\nSo that was his plan.\nSo the other thing then is.\nI know back in 2019, we did have one stipulation under section d, part three.\nThat was kind of an unusual thing on our business net.\nIs the sale of alcoholic beverages prohibited without special exception?\nBeer and wine sales, in conjunction with restaurants are excluded from this requirement.\nAll alcohol sales and services shall end at 10:00 p.m.\nbut we had set restaurant conditions at eleven, so I want to strike out that end of service at 10:00 p.m.\nand align it with the hours of the restaurant business.\nOkay.\nYeah, I think we just did that because that was part of the community meeting.\nThey had some.\nSome concerns about alcohol service, so that was the impetus for.\nI'd leave it until we get started and see how it works.\nYeah, because that was the reason.\nWell, yeah, but I'll just say that it's an unusual business stipulation to put on that you can operate a business for your next number of hours, but we want to limit what the business can do during those hours.\nWe do it every day.\nBut I didn't, so that would be my motion.\nOkay.\nWhat is your motion?\nMotion to accept resolution 240 eight with removal of section D three.\nLast line there.\nAll alcohol sales and service shall end at 10:00 p.m.\nwe'll just align it with the business.\nWe have a motion.\nDo we have a second?\nHaving no second.\nWe have no second.\nOkay.\nAnd simply motion then, for to accept resolution 2408 as stated.\nAs stated.\nWe have a motion to approve as stated.\nDo we have a second?\n2nd, we have a motion.\nWe have a second.\nAny other discussion?\nAll in favor, signify by saying aye.\nA aye.\nAye.\nOpposed?\nMotion carries unanimously.\nThank you.\nRecommendation to award purchase order to Dale Beasley Construction.\nYes, sir.\nGood evening, mayor, commissioners.\nThe existing 18 inch trunk line, sea Force man coming into the crest wastewater treatment facility requires repair and realignment.\nThe existing force man has a damaged fitting.\nAnd while we repair place that fitting, we would like to reconfigure the alignment of the force main, which will help resolve an issue we have with odors and the existing gravity main and the adjacent homes.\nWith that, staff would recommend the city purchase order in the amount of $202,620.39 to Dale Beasley Construction to repair and realign the 18 inch trunk line, sea Force may and I'll be happy to answer any questions.\nQuestions from the commission.\nSo it won't be lost funds when we move the sewer plant, is that.\nNo, sir.\nOkay.\nChecking.\nWe're going to try and do it.\nWhen we did, the plant got damaged.\nOkay.\nOkay.\nAny questions?\nNo, I know it.\nWe need a motion.\nI'll motion that.\nAlthough you're getting expensive every time you come up here, I want you to know, Jen.\nSo recommendation or motion to approve purchase order.\nDale Beasley construction for $202,620.39.\nOkay, we have a motion.\nWe have a

matters from our city attorney.\nI'll pass, mayor.\nThank you.\nOkay, matters from a city manager.\nOne brief item on the dais.\nI've handed out a guide to navigating common code violations and reporting issues.\nAnd I'd like to recognize Kelly and her code enforcement staff for putting together an easy reference guide for common code violations.\nWe felt like that this would be an opportunity to be a little bit more proactive in our approach to code enforcement.\nSo these pamphlets will be available for new residents when they come in and establish utility services.\nIt will also be online electronically.\nIt will be sent out via e news.\nAnd it was also being developed for direct mailings as well.\nSo just wanted to take a moment to pass that out to each of you for you to take a look at and again to recognize Kelly and enforcement staff for their efforts in putting together what I think is a very easy guide.\nAre you going to put them in the water bills?\nEmail ad separately?\nWe can do separate mailings, direct mailings to the home.\nThey'll be in the E.\nNews, they'll be online.\nThey'll be in the welcome packets for new residents as well.\nThis is great.\nThank you, Kelly.\nI would also want to say congratulations to Mark.\nIt's been a pleasure working with you and want to welcome Chloe and congratulate her on her election and certainly Colin

Despite the delay, all requirements of the ordinance will remain as previously approved. The commission also discussed concerns related to ongoing activities on the property and whether these were in line with the PCD\u2019s regulations.

month\n\nfairly active month obviously it's hard\nto believe a month is going by it seems\nlike it's been forever yeah yeah me too\nuh in the month of May uh the police\nunit we respond to 186 calls for service\nof those calls for service eight were\nvessel crashes with no significant\ninjuries um and one vessel fire which\nthey believe was caused by a cigarette\nbut I'm not I haven't gotten an update\non that um also want to share that the\nair show went really good I was very\nnice out but we had no real issues at\nall we actually were probably had a few\nboats less police boats there than I\nusually have but still it was we did\neverybody did a great job and and it was\nreally good weather great weather so a\nlot of boats um so we were usually after\nthe show we'll come in to the inlet and\nsit there just got slow everybody down I\ndidn't think those boats were going to\nstop coming I was like man there's got\nto be a thousand boats coming you guys\ndid a great job with that because we\nwent by yeah it was it was it was that\nwas that was real work there that 45\nminutes um something I also want to\nshare with you guys um our our\nagency along with FWC Coast Guard BSO\n\nand Hollywood we participated in in the\nM weekend operation called not this\nweekend\nthat was really started by myself and\nMatt gelli who's the sergeant of the BSO\nMarine unit um we try to get everybody\nin the county on board to try to just\nlike this countywide real just a real\nvisibility more than anything um and uh\nI think it went really really well I\nthought we were it was very productive\nand getting all of us from federal to\nstate to local County all of us working\ntogether um at once was was really good\nand I'll I'll share with you the uh our\nthis the stats for it um FWC got 20\nresource\nviolations um there's one\nBui uh there was one warrant arrest and\n\nthe Coast Guard shut down three illegal\nCharters um there were to over 200 um\nstops made and over 200 citations\nwritten um four them were\ncriminal 15 were civil and a ton of\nwarnings and a ton of like no fishing\nlicensees and that kind of stuff um we\nalso had one medical emergency someone\nwho probably been drinking too much dove\nin at the Sand Bar which you know is not\nvery deep and luckily wasn't paralyzed\nlike last year but he had a significant\ncut to his head one of my guys scooped\nhim up and come to the dock to get um\nmedical treatment um also there's a\nmigrant Landing in Hillsboro Beach um\nduring that time um mostly Dominicans\nand uh there was nine of them on board\nand six of them were recovered so it was\nreally good even without all the stats\nit was really good for all of us to kind\nof\nintermingle um my agency and BSO we were\non each other's boats and and and that\nkind stff to really get to know each\nother a little better and so I thought\nit was a really good weekend and I think\nit was real positive and and I think it\nreally had good impact on on the county\nthat\nweekend so FC draw brige uh that\nobviously caused you problems as well\nfor a while yeah that stuck down for a\nwhile yeah um I mean it was more problem\nfor everybody else than us I mean the\nonly problem we would have is if we got\nan emergency call back there then we'd\nprobably have to we probably have to\ntake our small boat on a trailer and\ntake it over to coolies and launch it\nyou know and then then go from there\nthat was a point you mentioned U quite\nsome time ago that you could not have a\nsituation where the bridge was down and\nyou didn't have a cop up the other side\nof the river so so that is something\nyou're addressing yeah that's something\nwith our staffing um because of the draw\nbridge is down and then so if I have if\nI have a call that I send somebody West\nthe bridge I have to send two officers\nto that call no matter what it is\nbecause if that guy needs a backup then\nI got no backup for him because the Road\nUnit can't help them so the TR is down\nso we have to really kind of play\nlogistical you know with that\num if it was something like stuck down\nlike that then we' probably would just\nour small boats on a trailer all the\ntime we would just grab it and take it\ncoly Del it real quick so um couple\nother things real quickly um on Steve\nglassman's pre- agenda call the other\nevening I know Liz was on that as well\nsomebody mentioned that difficulty\nreaching flp or Code Compliance Etc\nthere was an issue and somebody said I\ndon't know who to call I don't know who\nto call police I don't know they didn't\neven know code ofs existed but um I\ndon't know what the answer is other than\nperhaps some signage around the waterway\nthat says if you're in trouble there's a\nnumber but folks literally are on this\ncall don't Mo I know we're not going to\nresolve it something we all one you know\nnon emergency number you know we just\nhave to make it more visible I'm going\n\nto let leave you with one other thing\nand I'm going to toss this to our dear\nfriend Barry there's two there to\nexplain this um there was a we've seen a\nnumber of situations uh where folks feel\nit's okay to sand paint prep boats in\nthe\nwaterways photo that Barry got the other\nday of a large ass I believe\nis oh I'm sorry lard to sand Etc I\nbelieve Sergeant O'Neal is aware of this\num it's an ongoing issue guys so I kind\nof think it's the type of thing that you\nknow if you see it you got to say it\nthat simply not acceptable any comments\nthoughts you were obviously yeah so you\nknow um bar reached out to me with it I\nsent an officer this this kind of call I\ncan certainly help it it's more of a\ncode enforcement thing than their\nwarehouse than mine I can't I can't\nenforce it um we tried getting code a\nhold of code en fortunately to try to\nget them to come out I don't think they\nhad anybody working on the boat that day\num so I sent a officer as soon as I\ncould when the officer got there\ninitially they weren't doing any work on\nthe vessel at all um he talked to the\ncaptain and told him hey this is what\nthe ordinance says you can't do this you\n\ncan't do that can't do that um and then\nhe sent me that picture I immediately\nsent I didn't wait I immediately sent an\nofficer back there um fortunately we got\nthere again you know because we weren't\non the North End of the city we're on\nthe south end of the city um they\nweren't doing the work again something\nlike this we would have to see in person\nfor us to charge somebody with\num we can't just go by a photo of if it\nwas a felony then we could that's thing\n\nwith a misemer has a cur in our presence\nfor us to like that he again made\ncontact with the with the um with the\ncaptain again the guy running the crew\nwe also conducted\na sorry a report sent that to code\nenforcement as well as our own\nenvironmental\nperspectives I just think it's type of\nthing again that make when folks said\nyou know they don't know who to fall if\nthere's a if there's a accident or issue\nthis is similar something where we have\nto make sure that let folks know this is\nsomething they do need to report um I\nappreciate that yeah\nplease I I didn't expect\nto this would was going to be brought up\n\ntonight but um when you see something\nlike that and it's reported to you as\nthis was to me um you call code and I\ndon't believe that we should be giving\nour phone and names\n\nout it's a function of this board's Duty\n\nI think operating\nwithin the guidelines of the chapter\nthat we work\nunder and to put our name out that we're\nthe one complaining takes the burden\naway from the people who are\nviolating and I think it's up to Bo to\ndecide whether they think that's proper\nor not I personally don't think we\nshould have to surrender our name it's\nnot like\nthey're you know encroaching two feet\ninto this started because the boat's too\nbig for the canal that was what to my\nattention then the second phone was this\nguy's painting his boat down there\num so when I called they wanted the\nphone number and name and I wouldn't\nbeen didn't feel comfortable I didn't\nfeel her my understanding is is that's a\nrequirement for all Code Compliance\nitems that you must\nidentify the person reporting you can't\nit it doesn't have to be made\npublic but it does have to be reported\nthat's the requirement even when you use\nyeah when The Fix It app it's you don't\nhave to it doesn't show on the fix it\nit'll say neighbor say neighbor if\nthat's how you want to have it set up\nbut you have to but that's been a code\ncompliance requirement and I mean maybe\nI don't know if you know but I know that\n\nthat was brought up a number of times at\na used to be anonymous for accepting and\nthat was a problem that there were the\nnumber of reports that were false and\ncausing bigger issues I know that was\nbrought up at our um HOA in our area our\nCode Compliance person told us that was\nchanged a couple of years ago right Mr M\nSergeant I had an incident happened and\n\nI had the Florida marine Patrol come up\nwhen I had my barge and stuff and\nworking over Riv Riviera Isles\nand the sergeant and the two officers\ntold me that I had to move the barge\nbecause I did not have a permit the dock\nthat I was building now what I'm saying\nis I asked\nthe police officer at the time I said\nisn't this a code thing to start with\nnumber one and he said code had called\nyou guys and said that apparently they\nhad to enforce this and stuff and you\ncan tell you exactly where it is and I\nsaid I do have a permit for this it's on\nthe other side of the house I said this\nproperty is three lots Long all right\nand the permit and everything else I\nsaid this stock is $700,000 and stuff\nover there you sure that they got a\npermit what happened is I went he says\nfine go get the permit this is the\nsergeant now not code and this this is\nthe question I want to say do you guys\nenforce if the violation if somebody\ncalls code and says I think these people\ndon't have any new enforcement because\nwhen I went around the other side long\nstory short the owner had\nleft and uh put these box with the\npermit stuff inside his garage but\ndidn't have it so I long story short I\nhad to get one from my office that came\ndown there what the problem was is the\nhomeowner had Unity at tile with three\ndifferent properties pull the permit on\nthe other property which is allowed\nbecause otherwise you'd have to get a\npermit for the kitchen and everything\nelse and stuff so you can pull a permit\n\non the unity of TI the officers were\nhappy when I showed them that the point\nthat I was trying to get across this on\neven this\nviolation if there's a code\nviolation and stuff over there do code\nget a hold of you to go enforce that how\ndoes that how does that come with them\nno not not normal not normal not normal\nthat kind of thing like permitting\nzoning something like that that's\nsomething um if it's in you know if it's\nagainst the ordinances my the off police\nofficers can enforce it I don't like to\nmake it a habit of that because we are\nnot the subject matter experts with\nthose rules the code of fortunate people\nare I mean like you know I don't want\nthem out there enforcing criminal law I\nmean they can't even but you know I'm\nsaying like they're now we can and if\nthey're just completely not available\nwhat I normally do is I'll send an\nofficer to go there and see what's going\non and a lot of times it's something\neasy like yeah I do have a permit like\nsomeone calls all this guys have a\npermit for this work show up yeah here's\nmy permit okay good to go that way we\ndon't if not I will try to get a hold of\nsomeone that code enforcement to respond\nto to take care of it um because I don't\nit's it's not really our that's really\nwe could do it's not really our job to\ndo that kind of thing we intermingle a\nlot because of the availability of us on\nthe Waterway them on the Waterway the\nbiggest problem I'm saying is in in\n\nrelation to this barge pulls up to a\nhouse and stuff over there and the\nMarine Patrol comes over says you got to\n\nmove the barge because there's not you\ncan't load and unload equipment at this\nproperty right okay now whose violation\nis that is that yours or is that also a\ncode violation that's what the point I'm\ntrying to get across is you enforce that\nit's an it's an ordinance that code can\nenforce but I can also afford I can\nenforce just SP any ordinance as well um\ncode can't enforce like a guy with the\n\nopenal beard ordinance but you we can\nbut we we can enforce almost any city\nordinance but that's codes perview\nbecause they are more trained on those\nkind of violations in the police off if\nthis was like the only reason the Marine\nunit even really gets involved is\nbecause our availability if this was a\ncode enforcement kind of thing that\nhappened where they would set a street\ncop they wouldn't even send the street\ncop to it at all they would say refer\nthat to code enforcement unless someone\nwas something was dangerous happening\nother than that they wouldn't say only\nreason because of our availability\nversus Co availability under water well\nthat's what I saying she should know\nthat more than anybody else because a\nlot of places she has an idea place to\nload and unload bargin she is we come\nover there and stuff over there now\nthey've called I don't know whether they\ncall you or they call code enforcement\nbut Marine Patrol comes over and tells\nyou or gives you the fine for that parge\nso I don't know who they call but that's\na violation and stuff over there and\nthat's the point I was trying to across\nI think Barry was saying is there's the\nthe the enforcement is yours but the uh\nthey're in violation of let's say the\nthe code because they don't have a\npermit for that other than if it's a\n\ncity run job then for some reason or\nother they it goes one of these numbers\nand stuff over there you're allowed to\ndo that but the thing of it is is they\ncall and they'll say there's a barge on\nour easement and stuff over there who\nenforces that is it's code it's code I\ntry to get involved with that the only\nway I'm going to get involved with a\nbarge is if it's like a hazard of\nnavigation or something along those\nlines um something that's a state\nstatute for that kind of stuff I'm gonna\nlet tood hand handle\nthat thank you um Al so let me um we\nhave let me talk about the rest of the\nagenda real quickly we have a doc waiver\nat 1947 Northeast 21st Street the dock\npermit at 601 Cordova Road has been\npulled and we have a dock waiver at 700\nSouthwest fourth place um that we have\nsome familiarity with so we don't have a\nlong agenda I'm going to take a moment\nif I can to address what I refer to as\nthe elephant in the room if everybody\nnotices we don't see moratorium and\nreimagining and all that\num we um so if you all hadn't heard\nobviously you were informed that the uh\nmoratorium got shot down at the city\ncommission meeting on May\n7th in spite of the fact that we had a\nfirst reading um we got knocked out uh\nBob duncle came I was there Andrew was\nthere and varry was there so he didn't\nfeel well and decided to leave before\n1:30 in the morning when they fin got\n\naround to us so they got to us around 1\no'l in the morning um basically we\nstarted where John Herpst recommended\nthat we shorten the 12mon moratorium\nperiod to nine months then uh then it\nwas recommended I think it was Sturman\nwho said we should shorten to six months\nand this conversation went back and\nforth and um at that point we were fully\nprepared to accept a shorter time frame\nuh but there was again uh some craziness\ngoing on\namongst the people that joined and this\nwill give you some idea what happened\nhere and then at a point Dean tranta\nsays about no moratorium at which point\npeople in the audience who were there to\nsupport the opposition in the\n\nmoratorium applauded and Dean tranas\nheld his hand up and said tranis 2024 to\nme it was one of the most disrespectful\nthings that has ever happened in my\nbusiness life we spent two years on this\neasily year and a half with pnz meetings\nendless meetings Etc to simply be told\nno more so it is what it is uh I will\ntell you that we had reached out to\nmiasf the morning of and said we are\nanticipating headwinds and we can use\nsome Ben strength nobody from a miasf is\nthere we have one of the biggest\nsupporters of all in the room and that\nis John Kelly from Bradford Marine John\nwas unable to make it and a huge\nsupporter\nuh John unfortunately we got a message\nfrom Courtney day that morning and it\nsaid Steve it seems that everybody\nthinks it's 100% stop on any new docks\nand pilings they don't understand it's\njust for special requests pertaining to\nwaivers for docks piling seaw walls Etc\nso this is where we are uh none of us\nare quitters we're here and we're going\nto fight this battle and whether or not\nwe fight the battle on the morning\natorium or clean water or anything else\n\nwe can you do the best we can I\npersonally will not invest the amount of\ntime to be slapped around and told none\nof this is going forward my time is too\nprecious at 74 years old Andrew and\ncertainly Bob doual so we're going to\ncontinue functioning as an effective MB\nuh but we have to kind of rethink where\nwe're going this this so where do we go\nfrom here um I don't know where we go\nwith the moratorium I don't know where\nwe go with clean water I know that U\nJohn Kelly if he wishes to speak\nobviously is working with other large\nMarina operators who have vulnerability\nup there so the answer is we haven't\nwe're not done with this but for right\n\nnow it's tail bill I don't know if you\nhave any comments John if you want to\nmake any comments but the answer is is\nthat we did everything we possibly could\nwe summed up as we showed you last time\nwhat exactly the moratorium is how\nimportant it was the econom omic driver\nthe big takeaway and I've shared this\nwith John and others uh in my best\n\nfriend the town it's not the town the\nmajority of people who live in this\ncommunity care less about megga yach and\nthat's the Dilemma what they don't\nunderstand is the guy who owns a\nsandwich shop up there his whole\nbusiness depends on that so there's so\nmany folks that are affected by this\nthat the possibility of losing this\nbusiness is just unthinkable so I don't\nhave an answer uh it's just something\nwe're going to table for a while and\nwe'll readdress it but simply shutting\nthat off is not the answer that's all I\nSteve a couple things there's going to\nbe the city's\ngot uh funds and I don't know exactly\nwhere it stands right at the moment but\nthe bthc survey is going to continue and\nthat's a big deal in terms of like okay\nwhat is the center of this River and\nwhere the high spots and the low spots\nyou know U and you know with that\n\ncontinuing and you know we still have as\na a collective group to review and\ndiscuss waivers\nand certainly this is a very interesting\nlittle flyer that get sent out to you\nknow but\nuh so look you know it's a I would have\ndone the same thing if I was vly opposed\nto something I would do everything I can\nthe problem is the opposition is\ncompletely unfounded John did you ever\nhear no I I think all I would say is\nthat it's it's very clear that there's a\nlot of\nmisinformation it's a lot of\ndisinformation you look at something\nlike that flyer unfortunately it's it's\nit's not it's not simply relegated to\nthis one issue there's a whole host of\nissues in the local politics State\npolitics National politics that get back\n\nto those kinds of of Flyers because\npeople don't have the real facts I think\nlook the issue is it's not about it's\nnot about I like megats or I don't like\nmegats as an individual it's a question\nof what does this community where does\nthis community economic well-being come\nfrom that's a fundamental issue that I\ndon't know that very many people fully\nappreciate or understand it doesn't have\neverything to do with just beaches that\nthere's a reason why this community is\ncalled what it is the yachting capital\nof the world you can take your boat of\nany size to pretty much any local in\nFlorida and there's going to be a nice\nMarina and there's going to be a nice\nthere's going to be a nice Beach what\ndifferentiates for waterdale and Broward\ncounty is that it has a very significant\nServices component that has grown up\nover decades and it grew up in an\narea west of downtown on the New River\nfor a very specific reason number one\nback in the day there wasn't a whole lot\nout there except fields and Marsh and\nMangrove but it was also extremely\nimportant from the standpoint of being\nprotected by\nstorms in any given storm what does a\nboat traditionally do it runs to what's\ncalled a hurricane boat it runs into a\nlocation that is better protected\nprimarily from one thing which is storm\nsurge it's the increase in water depth\nthat has the most impact damage on\nboats that's what occurs on the New\nRiver where all of the service\nfacilities happen to be they are Inland\nsome four miles or so by virtue of the\nfact that there is less surge that can\noccur up there than there is when you're\ndown at the inter Coastal so that's\nwhere all these businesses have grown\nup that's where the yachts and boats\nit's not all Yachts we service boats\nthat are 30 feet 40 feet there are many\npeople that don't like boating that's\ntheir prerogative you know somebody may\nnot like golfing doesn't mean that you\nshouldn't allow golf courses to be built\nhere or there in this industry's\nparticular case it's a big reason why\npeople will move to Fort waterdale and\nother communities in Broward County it's\nsimply because it is a boating Capital\nit is a yachting Capital but it's that\nbecause you can get your boat serviced\nand the problem with the dock issues and\nyou know we all know it it takes one\ndock where a waiver is provided\ninappropriately that\nrestricts the\nriver talked about it at at a prior\nmeeting it's like the arteries to your\nheart you allow the clot to develop the\nboats can't get up there at which\npoint that industry goes away if you\ncan't get boats there then they're going\nto you know the business is going to\ndevelop someplace else and many might\nsay well who cares\nI personally believe that it's a big\nimpact and it's something that misf will\nneed to continue to spend time on\nexplaining to the community at large the\nCity commissioners and so forth what\n\nthat real economic impact is because\nit's well beyond the boat show it's all\nof the industry that surrounds us there\nare hundreds of businesses in Broward\nCounty that work on these\n\nboats it it it just it's we need to get\nbetter facts out there thank you very\nmuch it's\na very much so you know we're we're so\nwe're not done in the sense that we we\nunderstand whether it's the yachting\nCapital the Venice United States Etc\nwhat it really comes down to is so many\nof the residents in this community\ndepend on the the industry for their\nlivelihood there's many of us around us\nwho are charter boat captains Etc so\nwe're not done in the sense that I know\nas Bill said they're working on it other\nfolks are working on it John is working\nwith other large y owner yard yards Etc\nso it's not done uh what we did is get\nour ass handed to us and we learned from\nit we understand that we have to do a\nbetter job not just Ed educating the\ncitizens but the five Commissioners it's\nquite clear thank you anybody else want\nto share\nanything there's 140,000 marine jobs in\nBroward County two million people live\nin brow County probably million well\npaid well paid and then look and Barry\nwill'll get you in a second then John's\nmade the point earlier as other folks\n\nhave said what does it cost every time\none of those big Yachts goes up the\nriver the amount of money that's\n\ngenerated to the community and\nunfortunately again it's just not making\nits way to the Commissioners to\n\nunderstand so we'll do a different job\nwe'll do a better job but uh right now\nwe're as a go ahead P we need to be\nmindful that the the boat owner Captain\npays a premium to come up with yeah\nthey're towed up there I think it's\n$1,500 is about the average\ntoe they don't have to get a toe to go\n\nto daa they don't have to they don't\nneed a tow to go to Palm Beach or going\nup to St Lucy they'll get the boats\nrepaired somewhere but if it becomes\n\nmore difficult not necessarily blocking\nit off all together but if it becomes\nmore difficult to navigate the river\nthey'll simply go somewhere\nelse you know these big boats don't they\ndon't tend well with scratches and\nscrapes down the side\nand that's what I'm fearful of is that\nthey're still going to get the work done\nbut it may not be\nhere well they are developing more yards\nup in like four Piers per se Etc so yeah\nlike you said they're targeting it\nthey're going after this business and\nthere's nothing need to be towed into\nthose yard exactly right there's a\nreason that they want to be towed up\nbecause of the quality of the work and\nthe availability of what parts are\naround here when they're needed that's a\nmajor thing\nthat lers that's it's just a you know\nthat's not up in for St luy and other\nplaces yeah look it's it's a huge huge\npart of what fort waterdale is um so\nagain uh we know that folks like John\nKelly\nuh Bill Walker folks like that who are\ninvolved in the Marine industry are\nworking so we're here to support you\neverywhere Poss can and we will stay in\ntouch uh getting on the business side we\nhave excuse\nme we do have a doc waiver at 1947\nNortheast 21st Street uh I'd like to\nintroduce Lisa McConnell who is\n\npresenting Lisa where are you um Lisa\nsaid I'm not supposed to Andrew I'm not\nsupposed to say Lisa is completely new\nbut she's new to the presentation side\nof this so we're all going to be very\nsupportive and helper uh and you've got\nthe floor\nplease so I have the presentation that's\nthere on the screen I am Lisa\nrepresenting our client Christopher\nplace\num the address we just discussed at 1947\nNortheast 21st Street Christopher lives\non a stretch of the Middle River that\nhas very\nexpansive water over 200 feet and is\nsimply looking to extend past the 25\nfoot limitation for AER and Boat Lift to\nbe\nconstructed and the waiver is for\napproximately 14 feet based on the\nradius of his property line past the 25\nft um if you move on to the next slide\nplease you'll see a couple of pictures\nlooking off of the existing rear of the\nproperty across the the Waterway here so\nmany of the adjacent Canal areas might\nbe 80 feet 90 ft again this is well an\nexcess of 200 feet go to the next slide\nplease you can see on the Waterway and\nthe big open water to the left side of\nthe Waterway that's an illustration to\nscale of the proposed pier and boat lift\non the water clearly not an obstruction\nof the navigation there\nwell within the 30% rule Mr Place vessel\nLa 32 feet um it's 28 foot AAR that he\nwill put on this uh boat lift that is\nalso with access by the adjacent Pier to\nit sure um the next slide shows our\nproposed um structural plans these have\nbeen approved by all of the\nenvironmental agencies submitted to to\num Fort Lauderdale for building review\nand approval and obviously requiring the\napproval of this waiver of limitations\nbased upon the length here and distance\nout on the boat\nlift um as we just discussed with severe\nweather events and um the need for wind\nprotection and things especially on that\nlarge body of water running on the\n\nnortheast um the protection of his\nvessel is the main you know reason why\nwe would request that this\nbe approved again the location of his\nproperty and the um repairing rights of\nwater out off of his property definitely\nno navigational concerns whatsoever and\nthen in addition Mr Place took the time\nto speak to all of his neighbors in\nFriendly Manner and requested that they\nbe aware of his doc waiver he was\ninterested in doing and I submitted with\nuh the applic\na load of voluntary signed letters of\nconsent by all of the neighbors\n\nunderstanding that this is certainly\nlike I said something that's in an\neffort to protect a vessel and not a\n\nnavigational burden so are there any\nquestions so um first of all the the\npresentation is very well done the\npackage is terrific um reasonable\nrequest excellent submission I have\nnever seen\nso many letters of support Andrew are\nthere any letters of objection anybody\nopposed no I noticed all properties\nwithin 300 feet and I did not hear back\nfrom anyone so uh excellent job by the\nway uh I throw this out to the board any\nquestions\nconcerns relatively straightforward any\nissues anybody\nhas okay anybody like to make a motion\nplease yeah motion to approve second\nthere yeah beautiful so yeah Barry just\nmentioned have you seen the location\nthat's a beautiful spot by the way U\nit's a protected area there Absolut\nbeautiful location and there really is\nno issue with Vats in the area if we can\nplease yeah I'll do roll call\nVote Barry FL yes Norbert mlam yes John\nLynch yes Jason dunor yes Elizabeth\nJordan yes Robert Washington yes Bill\nWalker yes chair W approved that's A8 8\nto Zer unanimous sque\nby so great job um\ncongratulations best of\nLu that brings us to um brings us to uh\nI'm\nsorry that brings us to sub a subject\nthat I have wanted to mention for the\nlongest time we have a doc do way of at\n700 Southwest fourth place um I believe\nthis is Chappelle group is\npresenting and and if I was joking a\nlittle bit but you guys understand this\nis the property uh in sailboat Bend um\nthe doctors Meyers are kind enough to\njoin us Aon I'm pretty sure could do\nthis presentation at Point uh but they\ngot sidelined as a result of the waiver\nso if there is something positive coming\nout of the dismissal of that whole thing\nthis would be one of them so you got the\nfloor\nSaturday um you can see the do isap\nfalling\nin we are you know in the process of\ngoing through the environmentals and\nclusters right\nWest um this is existing conditions\nshowing the dising T the location of the\npil is about\nhere clusters out here these properties\nalong this section of the River on the\nnorth side of the\nRiver\nFlat lines are actually interior of\nexisting seaw walls on most of these\nproperties so we are here for a waiver\nfor the dock but if it was at the seaw\nwall like most properties we wouldn't be\n\nrequesting wa with the doc we would be\nfor the still the files but we got us\nyou know in this location anywhere from\n18 feet back to about 9 and half where\nthe property is\nrelationship W you can see the SE wall\nitself is pry linear it's not it's not\nstraight this is the proposed doc\num squared off the end um the applicant\nwanted to have this space worked out we\nadded a floating dock in the interior\nfor boards and then we're replacing\nthe are putting in new seaw wall um this\nproperty is one of the older\nproperties po applicant has spent\nconsiderable amount of time and energy\ntrying to replace this house and bring\nthe seaw wall up the backyard does\nflooded High Tides King tidde completely\n\nflooded um so we are raising SE wall up\nto five\nC\nproposing Dimensions um kind of to show\nthe property line\nDimension gers are Tak\nas well as we\n\nin the pil from 30% exibit City waiver\nrequest\nto 59.\n57.4 we have dist waivers 34\nand then floating do the one and half\nwaer request 26\nexping\ncircumstances all the piles and\nstructures are inside the 30% the\nWaterway this section of the river is\nabout 225 ft to 230 ft wide and that's\n\nmeasured not from the property line This\nis measured from the wet base to wet\nbase so um inside that 30\n30 and we are requesting this in order\nto saf more than best to put it on a\nboat\nobviously there's a lot of boat traffic\nin that River\nthese are just historical images um we\ndid this just to kind of show what the\ntype of vs were here before got a s at\none point some of the previous owners\nand it's been vacant for some\ntime right now they the owners are\nproposing you know smaller vessel that's\nthere boat lift and the outside vessel\nonce they have any money left to the\nhouse renovation they're going to\nlooking at a\n60 on that\noutside\nthere these are our letters of\nsupport the subject site here all three\nProperty Owners directly\nwest support as well as\n[Music]\nto and these are the waivers that have\nbeen\narea this is an\nexhibit\nwhile shows\nthe% with\nwater to idea where the\nsize of the boat going in here so the\nboat lift boat is about 24 ft 25 on the\ninterior of the L and the outside\n60 I think that is not you know they\nhaven't purchased the 60\nyet I think by that one diagram that you\nhave over there the one the last one\nthat you had in there I see the boats\nthat are on the other side of the river\nand stuff over there every single one of\nthem is touching the uh the 30% line and\none of them is over the 30% line every\nsingle one of them on that 25 thing\nevery single one is over that gone\nyeah you're\nreferencing but again all of our areall\nto the\nproperty is that brim\nSt down\nhere yeah but all those boats are gone\nthey should be\nyeah\nand so this is U uh as you probably\ncan't see they were right around the\ncorner from M Florida safe to say a very\nsensitive area so I think Tyler's taking\nthat\nconsideration uh the applicants have\nworked very hard on this they just had\nthe misfortune of having a property line\nreally that's just an odd one that's set\nway back the property um so relatively\nstraightforward other totally confusing\nand having seen the site one thing I'll\nguarantee you will not have any money\nleft by the time you they're doing a\nbeautiful home it's a spectacular site\nuh any questions from the board anyone\njust for pointing the ref's\nquestion the existing piles do they have\na waiver associated with\nmatter there was permits but not but\nnot 2005 was wa required oh yeah so it's\ninteresting because it seems that they\ngot the\npermits as they could have but then they\nwere installed by a firm incorrectly\nyeah\nand not reported\nthere that's why we're\nhere new\nones not curious just for BK Marine\nDistrict anybody else um it's\ninteresting to find errors you know we\nsee things like that it happens all too\noften um got a great team involved great\nproperty some it's making H contri to\nthe town and further questions from\nanybody how about the public any\nquestions from the public and I have a\nmotion motion Bill Walker and a second\nfrom Barry Flanigan roll call vote Mr\ncuber\nplease\nyeah Barry Barry FL yes nor M yes John\nLynch\nyes Jason dumbar yes Elizabeth George\nyes Robert Wason yes Bill Walker yes uh\nchair way yes congratulations guys great\njob thank you does this mean you don't\ncome back anymore though with\nokay I find it too interesting yeah see\ncan I can I piggy back off this yeah\nplease the possibility exists that in\nthe C upcoming months we'll be reviewing\nother waiver requests on the New River\nso um they may or may not have property\nlines that are\nthat that's but but they will be coming\nto us for\nquestion map like that so a 30% line\nlike no but the bathri survey\nis you're right we don't um I I think\nthat uh\nBob Franks had put together something\nthat was right was that a 25 I thought I\nmean something like we could put it's\ngonna be um How many slides would it be\nfor the whole\nriver\nfive it's really\nterrific what happened with the one that\nBob Franks did was it wasn't exact so\nfortunately when it went to the city\ncommission as an example they noticed\nthe yellow line which supposed to\nindicate 25 ft but it wasn't accurate so\nthat didn't help us but we should work\non this I actually thought of getting an\nintern do something like that spend a\nday I think it would be terrific\ninformation to have so I would to follow\nup on\nthat okay um old new business uh couple\nthings real quickly uh we have the July\nmeeting uh just to confuse everybody is\nnot July 4th um it\nis July is Tuesday July 9th take care\nguys because of the holiday uh Andrew no\n\ndoubt will send out more than one\nreminder but again it'll be the 9th not\nthe 4th there is no August meeting or\noff then uh let me take a second to\nacknowledge some reappointments here\nexcuse me we have four reappointments Ed\nred Hol um has been reappointed for\nanother year John Lynch Robert Frank and\nBruce donut thank you all for joining us\nto continue to contribute to this um\nso uh I have one other item myself but\nI'm going to throw it to anybody else\nbefore we go there anybody have no old\nnew business they wish to discuss\neverybody's G get their ass out of here\nand know this come one of the things is\nsaid maybe I to get the answer from I\nkeep hearing uh property line and wet\nface at the seaw wall now I said for\nyears few years four or five I said I've\nbeen doing seaw walls\nand never have we had that problem words\nwas always the wet face of the seaw wall\nif it was a property line reverted back\nto the shortest distance with a seaw\nwall these are plans the actual plans\nare on here but I hear back and forth\n\nwhere oh I got the property line and\nproperty line could be 5 to 10 feet out\ninto the water is where the property\nline is if you took the property line\nand I think that was brought up one time\nand then you want to go out for a\nvariance for from the property line out\nthat would be considerably a lot further\n\nI think Bob dle one time was mentioning\nthat it the property lines and stuff\nback but I don't know if you ever\nrealized property lines some of the\nplans I look some of the plans the\nproperty line is actually out into the\nwater five six feet more so we always\nhad I don't know how when you were doing\nyours and stuff we always had the wet\nface of the seaw wall is where you\nstarted to build the docks and\n\neverything all the plans were generated\nfrom the wet face of the seaw wall and I\nsaid I wanted to clarify that because it\nwas brought up a couple times that the\nproperty line and as far as I know the\nproperty line has nothing to do with it\nso there's no I don't think there's any\nreal answer all I see is ambiguity here\none of the problems we had with using\nthe uh wet Face's seaw wall is a number\nof properties had crumbled seaw walls\nand they sistered a wall in there and\nthen you're cheating if you're doing\nthat so I don't know the answer there\nplease so because the code indicates\ndistance from the property line it will\nalways be a measurement from the\nproperty line if the property line is\nwater word okay it'll be measured as it\nwas two meetings ago from the land\nproperty line because it code speaks to\nproperty line yeah I've seen I've seen\nthe property line when we looked at a\nset of plans yeah I've seen the property\nlines where they said this was the\nproperty line on the property they got\nyes and the property line was at least\n5T maybe 10t in the water absolutely we\nhad one of those two or three months ago\nand and and I was told be\nillegal that we should measure from the\nproperty line because the code speaks to\nthe property line and in this case it\nwas the property line that was en which\nresulted in a larger distance but it's\nexplained uh as as it was thoroughly and\nthe commission uh uh the commission\nhasn't reviewed that one yet but it it's\nexplained pretty thoroughly so um\nbecause the code speaks to property line\nit's on the other side of the coin I\nsaid I had to remove one one time where\nwe actually\nencroached uh four inches into the into\nthe thing where the property line was\nwas actually back and they went into\nthat we had we were already putting it\nin there and apparently the surveyor\nline was what they thought was on the\nproperty line but was the original a wet\nface yes one of the things was right\nthere with espach right around the\ncorner and stuff over there that was a\nmajor big property where the thing was\none foot difference between the property\nline and wet face to the seaw wall I was\njust trying to clarify that because I\n\nhear several things and I see several\n\nthings on here property line and wet fa\nto the seaw wall and back and forth we\nalways said what face of seaw wall have\nto be I want to say we used that more\n\nregularly a number of years ago with us\nit seems because of some of the\nconfusion and Andrew said it and Bob\nit's it's the property\nyeah it's it's handled differently when\nthe property L water workor versus when\nthe property l so so when it's when it's\nwaterw it's from the property line\nthat's landward when it's um when it's\nwhen the property L land workor it it is\nalso from the property line that's land\nit's always from the property and the\ncode enforcement notice they should know\nthat because that's the code the code\nsays from the\nproperty because we know it it does code\nfor\nwe used to handle it a little\ndifferently you're right we used to say\nwhen the property land was uh was water\nword we would do it from the from the\nfrom the white face that's where ESP\nespan actually gained one\nfoot forward into the river stuff over\nthere for where their property line was\nas opposed to the original wet faith and\nthe Sea wol so they were able to move\neverything one foot forward well if\neverybody started doing that and\neverything else and stuff you're going\nto reduce the size the the river itself\nkiss Thank you kiss the thought I\nappreciate it so um uh we were talking\nabout Bob dun Bob dun's away on vacation\nI think he might be back next month well\nnext we'll see but we'll bring this up\nwith him certainly discuss this further\nanybody\nelse just a point of clarification old\nnew business um can I get a definition\nof what that actually is this where you\nbring up something like if you see\nsomething or is this just talking about\nold business I think it's no old\nbusiness and the sense is there\nsomething that we've continued a\nconversation on new business anything\nyou want to talk about okay so I don't\nknow if this it is the right I think it\nis but does the city have an appetite\nlike an appetite\nfor um adding docks that uh small boers\nlike even the or the large boers when\nthey put their dingies in the water and\nwant to travel around uh the our\nwaterways we have like uh for example\noff of Sebastian Road over on the beach\nwould be a wonderful location where\nthere's some public parking there that\nyou could have a dinghy dock that would\nbe uh could be installed and people um\nfrom the locals could have beach access\nby boat and there's almost no beach\naccess by boat it's staggeringly\ndifficult if you have a boat and you\nwant to go and spend your money Beach\nand as we all know anybody that gets\narrives by boat usually has a wallet on\nand they'll spend when they walk off the\nboat the docks at um at ber State Park\nwere staggeringly difficult to get done\nbut I think find was the one that put up\nthe money for\nthat it was both but those have are now\nunusable because they're just not being\nmaintained actually big ass boat hit the\nthing broke it State owns it states in\nfor appropriation\nkill you but they're saying in the next\nsix months or so it's gonna get F\nokay um months from when so you're\ntalking about\nstreet right away and there's there's\ntwo things going on there bill will\ntells you that he's likes to use them\nfor water taxes period in the street but\nthere's also the adjacent homeowners\nElizabeth Elizabeth would tell you that\nyou know there may be a situation with\nthe adjacent totally understand that so\nso Street ends like Sebastian I think is\nStreet end um it's something we can talk\nabout we can encourage but I'm not sure\nhow far them yeah it's just a this is\nthe man that will tell us exactly what's\ngoing on that would be you one of the\none of the troubles with the floating\ndock that's there is one who's going to\nrun it who's going to manage it the\nother is is that because of the\nanchoring\nordinances it's going to be filled with\nfreezers that are going to go ashore to\ngo to the grocery store isn't that a\ngood thing well well um it is if you\ndon't live\nthere you know they hang their laundry\nthey pay their\nmusic trash they have all the trash and\nso there's it's not that we of those\nplaces I'm just telling you that this is\nwhat comes with those types of thing we\nhad one at George English park for\nexample that before they put that\nanchoring restriction Zone in the Middle\nRiver people were\nupset because they're anchor they're\n\ntying up close to the Sea walls within\n100 feet looking in the windows people\ncan see them out sunbathing on their\n\nboats or whatever the that's the\ncruising thing the dingy side of it is\nit it becomes public for\neverybody and therefore it's going to\nattract others and there may or may not\nbe room for you there depending on how\nbig the boat is I I get that there's but\neven like if you look at the west side\nof Las soless Bridge there's where the\nold bridge used to exists there's a\nbeautiful seaw wall right there it's\nit's massive it easily could put a dock\nthere and then people would could then\nwalk to that little park there and then\ngo over the\nbridge yeah but or they could go no I\ndon't think it's just a it's it's he's\n\non the west side on the West\nSide redo the wall where\nthei oh yeah yeah B but that I obviously\nyou probably get pushed back from M wild\nbut there you know there's very\nvery but they're you know I'm\njust it would have to be Ada so stre\n\nwon't allow for the 12 one slope or\nwhatever at the end of those streets\nbecause you don't have enough area\nunless you go way out into the ramp so\nthat's the that's the that's one of\nChallen and I trust me I completely\nunderstand the not in my neighborhood\nbut when you do buy a property on the\nwater like for example the Middle River\nAnchorage access I was very opposed to\nthat that that they got rid of it\nanchorages I think are a good thing for\na community um because it does allow the\nsmaller boater that eventually becomes\nthe bigger boater it Farms our future to\nsome degree and when you bought the\nproperty you should have known that that\nwas there I get but and that so then on\nthat I get why adding something new that\n\nwasn't there becomes more of a problem\nbecause if you were a homeowner but I do\nthink that there's a value to this\ncommunity by adding some public access\nto the beach from dingies from tenders\nused to be L Solus before that we leased\nit out yeah remember come welcome do\nyeah\nactually there's there's going to be\nsome building up down\nbyth Station South of the EMR where the\nJung is so by where the OB\nwas is around the corner this couple of\ndoors down\nfrom the Jungle Queen comes in and goes\ninto their little corner slip the city\nhas a piece of property there that had\nit had seven slips on it it's now four\nuntil we get our licenses but the water\ntax is taking it over and there may be a\nspot\nthere okay it's a good idea but it's a\nit's a big issue yeah I really think\nit's something that a lot of the smaller\nvoters would benefit to do something\nyeaha um anybody else so I'm gonna take\na moment before we leave uh to uh this\nwas mentioned actually to me by a couple\nof you folks and that is to acknowledge\na couple folks here we spent so much\ntime working on moratoriums all this\ncraziness Etc and I want to acknowledge\nthe poe of our group here and that would\nbe John luscom and Andrew Cuba and I\ntake the time to do this because these\nguys are\njust We Care a great deal about you two\nof you are our friends and that we\nbelieve our community Waterfront Parks\nEtc are in better hands as a result of\nit I made one mistake that I'm going to\ncorrect so this is on behalf the Marine\nAdvisory Board this is to John lus and I\nmade a mistake say city of for\nLauderdale marine Advisory board thank\nyou John W recognition of eight years\nnow I made a mistake because I found\nthat it was actually 15 years but it was\nnot consecutive so\nchanges 15 years in recognition

to start\nWednesday or Thursday next week so\nthat's it so we'll see and it's about\nthree days it'll take you any updates on\nthe seaw walls in front of the\nwarp uh Yes actually um we met we have a\na design and permitting consultant that\nwas brought on board yeah uh we met um\nI'm going to say two weeks ago there\nyeah and the idea that we're looking for\nthem to design is to not originally they\nwanted to put that can of lever yeah\nwalkway I don't think we need it uh\nbecause the price is pretty high to put\na port kind of configuration there so\nit's really going to be just a seaw wall\nthat would look continually like the\nrest of the New River with Fender piling\nthere uh we're going to put Power in um\nwe're going to put a floating dock at\neach end so there'll be a floating dock\nat is it River tail yep and the other\n\nend will be by the the avenue bridge by\nthe where the it's going to be where\nthere's a straight area in front of\n\nriver tail there'll be a floating duck\nthere and a living seaw wall behind it\nand then on the other end down near the\npump house there'll be another floating\ndock there with a living sea wall behind\nit that's great so and they're also um\nthey're we have a grant presentation not\ndoing it public works is doing it but\nthey're going up to find on the 22nd of\nJune to make a pitch to get some\nassistance there for that project so\nthey're going for three million uh the\nestimate on the dock is somewhere in the\n9 million doll range you can believe it\ndidn't they have\n4.5 they had that in the kitty right\nwhich is turning out to be a match\nwhere's that kitty now it's still\nthere it's still there the money's there\nso what are we looking at year and a\nhalf two\nyears uh I don't know when they're going\nto have drawings I I would imagine we\nprobably see 30%\nby couple of months and then it just\nkeeps going as you know um and\nthen the construction side of it is\ngoing to be\ninteresting it looks like it'll be just\nregular sheet piling driven down in\nfront the cap tied together and u and\n\nthat's it so that's where that is City\nstill well there's still a brick of\nlicense that's there um that the the\nwarf holds and we just I'm not sure\nwhere that's going to\ngo the best I can tell\nyou anybody else July 9th is a\nTuesday the next meeting on the Tuesday\nwe already mentioned it's not on the\nThursday\nwe get a reg I don't know hope she's\ncoming\nsoon bar wanted to know when the regular\ngirl thank you all this an excellent\nmeeting thank you all for coming uh if\nnobody else has any other issues we will\nadjourn motion to adjourn a second\nplease second"}, "news_articles": [{"title": "Local Police Report Highlights Increased Coordination and Safety Operations", "body": "At the latest municipality meeting, Sergeant O'Neal provided an overview of the police unit's activities in May. Despite its seeming brevity, the month was packed with critical incidents and collaborative operations. The police unit responded to 186 calls for service, which included eight vessel crashes with no significant injuries and a minor vessel fire suspected to be caused by a cigarette butt. Additionally, the annual air show went smoothly with the police ensuring safety with fewer boats than usual.\n\nOne significant operation, 'Not This Weekend,' which was initiated by Sergeant O'Neal and Matt Gelli of the BSO Marine Unit, saw extensive collaboration among various law enforcement agencies including FWC, Coast Guard, BSO, and Hollywood. The operation aimed for county-wide visibility and proved to be productive with over 200 stops, citing 200 violations, including four criminal charges and 15 civil violations. Key outcomes included three shuttered illegal charters and a migrant landing involving nine individuals, with six recovered. This operation underscored the efficacy of multi-agency cooperation, making a notable impact on county safety and security.\n\nOn the infrastructure side, the stuck drawbridge at Hillsboro Beach posed logistical challenges, particularly affecting the police unit\u2019s deployment strategies. Another pressing issue raised was the difficulty residents faced in reaching code compliance and emergency contacts, emphasizing the need for better public communication and signage.\n\nSergeant O'Neal also addressed environmental concerns regarding improper sanding and painting of boats in waterways, which falls under code enforcement. While the police unit handled initial complaints, enforcement ultimately remains the domain of code officers. The meeting concluded with a discussion on the need for clearer reporting protocols and community awareness regarding code violations.\n\nOverall, the meeting highlighted a month of successful collaboration, efficient emergency response, and ongoing efforts to address both safety and environmental concerns in the community.", "keywords": ["police operations", "community safety", "multi-agency collaboration", "code compliance", "emergency response"]}, {"title": "Marine Unit's 'Not This Weekend' Operation Results in Numerous Violations and Arrests", "body": "During the municipality meeting, Sergeant O'Neal provided an in-depth report on the 'Not This Weekend' operation carried out by the local police unit in conjunction with FWC, the Coast Guard, BSO, and Hollywood police departments. The collaborative initiative aimed for heightened visibility and enforcement over a weekend in May. Spearheaded by O'Neal and Matt Gelli of the BSO Marine Unit, the operation covered the entire county and proved markedly successful.\n\nThe operation resulted in over 200 stops and citations, with a mixture of criminal and civil violations being addressed. The FWC cited 20 resource violations, and the Coast Guard shut down three illegal charters. Additionally, the operation led to one warrant arrest. There were also four criminal citations and 15 civil citations issued. Importantly, the operation enabled various law enforcement entities, from federal to local, to work cohesively. Limiting code violations, such as no fishing licenses and controlled alcohol consumption, were also flagged during the operation.\n\nAlongside citations, significant events marked the weekend. A medical emergency involved a person who sustained a serious head injury after diving into shallow water at the Sand Bar. Quick action by the police unit ensured the individual received prompt medical treatment and avoided potential paralysis. Another incident involved a migrant landing at Hillsboro Beach, where nine Dominicans attempted entry; six were successfully intercepted.\n\nBesides emphasizing the immediate outcomes, Sergeant O'Neal noted the long-term benefits, such as enhanced coordination and mutual understanding among different law enforcement agencies. This collaboration is crucial for handling the county's varied and dynamic safety needs effectively.\n\nOverall, the 'Not This Weekend' operation was a testament to the power of unified law enforcement efforts, significantly boosting marine and public safety over the targeted weekend.", "keywords": ["'Not This Weekend' operation", "marine safety", "law enforcement collaboration", "citations and arrests", "public safety"]}, {"title": "Navigational Challenges and Solutions: Hillsboro Beach Drawbridge Stuck", "body": "The municipality meeting featured a critical update from Sergeant O'Neal concerning logistical challenges posed by the stuck drawbridge at Hillsboro Beach. The bridge issue created considerable disruption, not just to local residents and commuters but also to the police unit's operational efficiency.\n\nSergeant O'Neal outlined specific concerns regarding emergency response. Given the bridge's location, any west-side deployment now requires doubling up officers for all calls, ensuring backup is available in emergencies. The temporary strategy involves using smaller, trailered boats to navigate emergency responses west of the bridge, ensuring rapid deployment despite the obstruction.\n\nThe stuck bridge problem elucidated broader infrastructure vulnerabilities that could further complicate public safety operations. O'Neal noted that while the bridge issue affected broader community mobility more than police operations, it did highlight the necessity for adaptable response plans in the face of infrastructure failures.\n\nThis incident encouraged discussions around staffing, resource allocation, and strategic planning. It emphasized the need for ongoing support and flexibility within the police force to navigate unexpected infrastructure challenges effectively. Ensuring continuous and effective operations even when faced with such crises requires thoughtful logistics and resource management.\n\nThe bridge issue underscored a broader problem the municipality needs to address: the state of critical infrastructure and its impact on community safety.

Steve Glassman raised the issue on a pre-agenda call, emphasizing the confusion some residents faced in knowing whom to contact in different emergency and non-emergency situations.\n\nDiscussions pointed out that many residents were unaware of code officers' existence or their specific roles in addressing issues like environmental compliance or infrastructural concerns. This communication gap has led to inefficiencies and frustrations among residents who need quick responses to their concerns.\n\nSuggestions to improve this situation included placing clear signage around waterways and community gathering spots. These signs would provide residents with a visible, easy-to-remember non-emergency number. Ensuring residents are informed and know precisely whom to call could significantly enhance the response times for both non-emergency and emergency issues.\n\nImproving community awareness is also vital in ensuring that residents comply with environmental regulations. The meeting highlighted instances of improper boat sanding and painting, which can have significant environmental impacts. To address such violations, code enforcement officers often need clear reporting and immediate evidence. Better public understanding of these processes and quicker reporting mechanisms could facilitate more effective code enforcement.\n\nOverall, the discussions highlighted the need for a more streamlined and visible approach to community communication regarding emergency contacts and code compliance. By making these contacts more accessible and understandable to the general public, the municipality can enhance overall community safety and wellbeing.", "keywords": ["community safety", "emergency contact visibility", "non-emergency number", "municipal communication", "code compliance"]}, {"title": "Local Addresses Environmental and Safety Code Violations", "body": "In the recent municipality meeting, one area of significant concern was environmental and safety code violations within local waterways. Sergeant O'Neal and Barry discussed ongoing issues surrounding improper boat maintenance activities, emphasizing the community's role in reporting violations such as sanding and painting boats in the waterway.\n\nThe meeting noted that while immediate enforcement of such violations falls under code compliance jurisdiction, the police unit often responds to initial reports. The enforcement of these codes requires visible evidence, which means officers need to either witness the violations firsthand or receive substantiated photographic evidence. This procedural necessity highlights the importance of community vigilance in addressing and reporting violations promptly.\n\nIn one highlighted incident, a resident reported a large boat engaged in sanding and painting activities. Despite initial compliance upon the police's first visit, follow-ups were necessary to ensure continued adherence to environmental codes. This incident underscores the collaborative effort needed between law enforcement and code compliance authorities to manage such violations effectively.\n\nAdditionally, the meeting stressed the need for better public education regarding the environmental impact of such activities. Community members often remain unaware of the legal requirements and environmental consequences of maintaining boats inappropriately. Campaigns to increase awareness and the implementation of clearer reporting procedures could help mitigate these issues.\n\nConclusively, the municipality is focusing on improving communication channels, enhancing public awareness, and tightening enforcement mechanisms to address environmental and safety code violations more effectively.

with regard to property located\nat 502 Mars Avenue and 5 L Avenue block\n502 Lots three and four first um I want\nto thank the board for providing the\napplicant with the opportunity to revise\nthe plans to address comments made by\nthe board members at the last hearing um\non February 21st\n20124 the applicant listened took the\n\ncomment seriously and directed his\nprofession professionals to revise and\nredesign certain aspects of the plan to\nbe responsive to all the board comments\nthose revisions and redesigns have\nresulted in the elimination of the\nfollowing variances the location of the\ndumpster in the residential Zone tandem\nparking and all signage\nvariances the revised proposal also\nreduces the variance for the number of\ncommercial vehicles to be stored outside\novernight the original proposal called\nfor six vehicles uh this new plan\ncontemplates four vehicles outside where\none is permitted and two will be um\nstored inside the main building the\nrevised plans also aim to address the\nremaining open administrative comments\ntonight the applicants experts are here\nto highlight the changes to their\nrespective plans and the presentation\nwill conclude with some planning\ntestimony based on those revised plans\nif the board has any questions for me\nI'd be happy to answer them otherwise I\nwill call the first Witness\nquestions from the\nboard okay let's move on uh Bill Hollows\nis the first\nwitness and I'll just note for the\n\nrecord Mr Hollow was previously sworn\nremains under oath his credentials as an\nengineer were accepted in the prior\nhearings\nfine okay so uh using the revised plans\nwith a date of April 24th\n2024 and exhibit A10 which is a colored\nsheet 3 of 10 of the April 24th 2024\nplans can you describe for the board the\nrevisions and redesigns to the plans\nproposed in response to the board's\ncomments from the last hearing and in\nresponse to any outstanding administr\nadministrative comments from the city's\nprofessionals what I have in front of I\ndon't think I'm\nthere have been problems with that you\ncould turn that around and grab\nit what I have here before you is sheet\nthree it's our layout plan we we'\ncolorized\nthis\nand starting off with some of the\nchanges that we made we eliminated the\ntandem parking we now have\nfour\nstalls uh the closest ones to Morris\nAvenue those four stalls stalls stalls\nwill be for the uh the commercial\nvehicles and then the intent is to put\ntwo more commercial vehicles inside the\nbuilding you can see that we eliminated\nthe tandem was in this general area and\nnow we just have the four stalls the\n\naisle becomes a little bit wider because\nI really can't push this parking this\nway because of the location of the\nbuilding it would affect the other\nparking\nstalls so we have a little bit wider so\n\nthese commercial vehicles would have a\nlittle better in and out to their\nparking stalls and because of this\nmoving these parking stalls over we're\nable to move the dumpster\nenclosure forward towards Morris Avenue\nout of the residential Zone and into the\nstrictly into the business\n\nZone we've corrected or made the\nhandicap access or the handicap Ada\nparking stall uh work a little bit\nbetter a little better function with the\nsidewalk and what we've done\nif you recall we had these these stairs\nthat go up to the apartment on the\n\nsecond floor and what we're planning on\ndoing is putting a fence to the back and\nthe side of those stairs so that it\nreduces the visibility of these parking\nstalls to anyone on Lowel Avenue and\nthat's another reason why we move these\nparking stalls back a little bit is so\nthat they were hidden more from anyone\non LEL\nAvenue in addition there were some\ncomments about protecting the stairs and\nwe we had pipe ballards on along that\nuh be the Westerly side over the\nstairs and we've added a curve line in\nthat area\nalso there was some talk about well we\n\ndid have discussion about the lighting\nand if you recall there's the light in\n\nthis\nlocation which is about midway between\nthe parking stalls closest to the\nresidential Zone and that would be put\non a motion\nsensor and the flood lights will be\nremoved from the garage and the\narchitect can talk to what he's\nproposing to put in their place but they\nwould be\nremoved and again there'll be a there is\na light by the man door on the side for\nthe apartment entrance towards the front\nof the building building and then there\nwould be one added to the door that goes\ninto the uh\noverhang of this the back\napartment and the storm water management\nplan has been changed um I think you if\nyou recall I first started out with some\ndry Wells over in the corner of LOL and\nMars they were removed and then we have\na storm scepter system that's going to\nbe in this grass area\nuh so it wouldn't be visible it's\nunderground and that would drain out\ninto the uh the County's Road there's a\nstorm draining system that goes along\nside of mors Avenue our side of actually\nwe've relocated the shed so that it's\nmore parallel to the parking stalls\nagain that would be visible from L\nAvenue\nand there was discussion that we need a\nvariance because we go over the property\nline with our the light and it's it's\nreally if you recall it's just a very\nlittle bit on L Avenue that's actually\nbetween the property line and the curb\nline it doesn't even go out into the\nstreet and then there was some little\nbit of light in the um\n\nEnterprise rental car parking lot and\nit's when I say little we're talking\nMoonlight in that in that general area\ncan you talk about the signage um with\nregard to the no parking area and exit\nonly on Mars\nAvenue uh the building exit only oh okay\nwe're going to put we're put a sign out\nhere there be exit only no entrance into\nthe into the building we know parking in\nthat that exit\ndriveway really as you recall there's a\ndoor in the back of the building there's\na door in the front and the vehicles\nwould enter from the back and then exit\nfrom the front most likely um stored in\nthere so it' be just potentially two\nvehicles a day that may come out of that\nparking area or the inside parking\narea and these plans have been\nresubmitted to Union County engineering\ndepartment through their planning board\nDepartment uh that was done earlier in\nJune and we're awaiting that approval or\nhopefully approval it and their their uh\ncomments really had to do with new\n\ncurving new sidewalk along the frontage\nof Mars Avenue and that's been shown on\nthe\nplans and again when uh they review the\nplans they review the storm drainage\nsystem because it will go into their\nsystem in mors after\nthank\nyou I don't have any questions\nokay\nMarine so no we we review can you bring\nthe microphone down\nsorry we reviewed the plans um that were\nsubmitted um so there's been two\nrevisions to our engineering letter\nsince the last time you saw these plans\nso there's been two revisions um and we\nreviewed the um the storm water that\nwould be one of the big things and we\nhave no we take no exception to the way\nit was designed um the stormw Water\nReport um there was uh some lighting\nconcerns that we took a look at we have\nno um we take no exception to that so I\ndon't I don't know that I have any\nfurther comments on\nanything good evening um Ed snikes with\nBurgess Associates we uh submitted a\nreport on June 14th\n20124 um and what the applicants done\nthrough testimony from the engineers has\nprovided any of the or address most of\nour questions I just had a few other\nones regarding um will will the uh\nspaces 11 through 14 be the commercial\ndesignated parking\nspaces for overnight parking yes okay\nand the remainder of the spaces are\nbeing used for the residents that will\nbe inhabiting units upstairs as well as\npotentially employees correct on the\nfirst is 2 through five are designated\ntenant space\nokay thank you\num okay I think that's all the questions\nthat I had I think you addressed the\nmotion sensor light and I presume the\narchitect will talk about the building\nmounted light correct on the fixtures\nokay thank\nyou questions from the\nboard I have one um\nthe employees I'm thinking of the time\nwhen they come in and the time when they\nleave they then each employee has two\n\nvehicles where do they go they the one\nthey drove in to work\nwith and then they'll be parking it\nwhere their vehicle\nwas what happens in between so can I\nwhen they get their in their their rout\n\nfor the day any special instructions\nload any equipment whatever that's a\nperiod of time that I'm afraid is going\nto wind up on L Avenue um I think that\nthat question would would be best\nanswered by um the applicant if you\nwould like him to answer and\nrespond\nokay is he going to testify later or no\nbut he could he's here he can answer\nthat question uh yeah that that probably\nwould be appropriate and we'll get it\nout of the way\nsure and you were PRI prior testimony\nyes he was previously sworn remains\nunder so we're good to go yes uh we've\nbeen operating out of this space since\nuh\n2011 and we've never put uh any of our\nemployee vehicles on lull so what\ntypically happens is we either go guys\nwill drive directly to job sites in\ntheir own\nvehicles or they will car pull together\nso not every employee drives a vehicle\nto the site typically I would say if\nyour job needs five men we might have\nthree and one one vehicle and then one\nor two will drive there directly so\nsince 2011 we've never parked vehicles\non L okay all right I'm just trying to\nfind out where where where they where\nthey go at that that 9:00 hour when\nthey're trying to get everything I know\nit's\nlike before before you yeah before you\nleave got a couple questions you yeah\ncouple questions here just follow up on\nthe parking uh Mr H has addressed part\nof the question about designating spaces\nfor people employees residents whatever\nwill they be clearly marked with signs\nor absolutely absolutely we don't like\nchaos um we we try to run an efficient\nbusiness so time is money so we don't\nwant them to figure out who's parking\nwhere and also the zoning officer wanted\nto ask wanted us to get testimony\nconfirming your hours of operations um\nuh typically I would say 8:00 a.m. and\nthen 5:00 p.m. maybe 6:00 p.m. the\nlatest but typically it's an 8 to window\nso play arriving at 8 yes and then\nleaving at the end of the day at I would\nsay 4:30 by 5:00 they're out of there\nokay unless there's a different\ncircumstance where they're doing a job\nsay in Manhattan they get stuck in\ntraffic coming through the tunnels or\nthe bridges and then there might be one\nvehicle that's later and typically\nthat's a civilian vehicle if we're doing\nwork in Manhattan we typically take a\nminivan that's not a commercially marked\nvehicle\nokay uh should we make the U signs on\nthose uh spots a condition so if I could\njust interrupt I'm sorry the the tenant\nspots have signage already on the plans\nit shows tenant parking but you just\nindicated there would be others that\nwould have them yeah I meated so maybe\nthey should our idea is to give whatever\nemployee a designated spot so there's no\nconfusion that's my intention I I mean\notherwise we don't have\nefficiency okay that work that work for\neverybody yeah okay I just have a\nquestion couple well just one maybe two\nquestions um are there going to be any\nother contractors parking on your\nproperty after hours no\nokay okay and I noticed that on the new\nplans I it wasn't wasn't ran by the Fire\nofficial or fire chief uh now that we're\nparking Vehicles inside does that change\nthe fire load inside the building since\nyou have vehicles with fuel in there we\n\nfireproofed it okay that all was done a\nyear ago okay we also Highwire the uh\n\nsmoke system for about the tune of\n$10,000 okay that doesn't include the\ncost of insulation fireproof bat and\ndouble sh double drial thank you very\nmuch we have a high rating\ngood any other questions from the\nboard Mr chairman seeing none sorry oh\nyes sir yes if I could just interject I\nhearing about the signage issue of\nparking spaces I know you've indicated\nyou've uh signed the uh employee parking\nexcuse me the resident parking spaces\nbut will the employee spaces be signed\nor just assigned assigned assigned so\nthere won't necessarily be assigned\ndesignated for each one of those spaces\njust want to make sure that's clear if\nthat's what the board's and that was\nwhere I was going was you know that\nsomebody pulls\nin a customer and parks in an employee\nspot well we don't have typically we\ndon't have retail customers that's not\nour business model I mean anything we do\nis off site we go and we look at a job\nor building or home and and very very\nrarely does anybody come there and visit\nus unless somebody's dropping off\nwallpaper or somebody's coming and\ninquiring about specialty finishes and\nstuff like that my intention that was to\nput the tenants label the tenants One\n\nTwo Three or one two 3 4 as tenant\nspaces because those and they'll know\nthat's theirs you know and that's that's\nyou know that's a priority\nand you won't be renting to any\n\ncontractors or something like that to\nlive upstairs and have a car trunk\ndownstairs no I that's I hope it's a\ngood question it's a great question but\nyeah I mean you have an electrician\nupstairs who lives there with it you\nknow with his wife it has it has its\nperks though you\nokay uh anything else from\nanybody okay let's move on to your next\nWitness should open two questions from\nthe public oh for either of those my\napologies I I forgot the public um any\nquestions for the witness from the\npublic Are you standing up to ask a\nquestion or are you the next witness\nhe's the next\nwitness I had I got to find out okay\nthank you and then we will move to your\nnext okay uh the next witness is Michael\nMcNerney the architect\nquestion what maybe he'll ask question\nokay that work noting once again for the\nrecord that he was previously sworn in\nhis credentials as an architect were\npreviously\naccepted great um can you highlight for\nthe board the changes to the\narchitectural plans and address any\n\nadministrative comments or outstanding\ncomments by board members from um this\nor any prior\n\nhearing the the changes that were that\nwere made based on the comments from the\nboard prob the first one is I had put\ntogether a an F worksheet to show how we\nderiv that number when doing that I I\nrealized that I\nincluded the square footage of both\nDormers and said that was the square\nfootage of the new Dormer the new Dormer\nis actually 32 fet not 64 squ\nft um but the the overall f is still the\nsame as as as at we the last\nmeeting the the other comment was\ndealing with the well I I did not show\nany sign information since we are no\nlonger putting a new sign we are just\nrefacing the existing sign and that has\nbeen done that has already been\npermitted and do not this um the other\nissue is really just the lightting we\ntalked\nabout um having a more of a a\nresidential field from the lighting and\nwhat I had done was I I I basically used\nan arts and craft style like Carriage l\nthat I apply to the garage wall and have\nso we have two two lights on the G along\nthe garage for that and then I I show a\nlight at the top of the stairs because\nthat was also mentioned that uh from the\nresidential\nbuilding can you just show that on your\nplan see it on as far as the carriage\nlighting uh it it's located here and\nhere and that's on the\ngarage for the for\nthe for the for the main\nbuilding the lighting is basically is at\nthe top of the stairs and I show that\nwhere I show that upper left thank you\nhere it\nis over here at the top of the stairs\nand again it's it's a arts and craft\nstyle\nFL and I think that's all all that I\nhave changes those are the only\nquestions I have for the\narchitect from chairman uh just\nregarding the light fix fixture that has\nbeen added it seems like this is a\nrevised if I'm not mistaken revised\nfixture it seems like a fixture right\nnext to the handicap parking space\nthat's mounted to the building was that\nthere\nbefore actually the handicap space um to\n\nthe tenant entrance yeah maybe you could\nlook at the site plan you'll see what I\nmean oh the site\nplan over here you're saying yeah\nthere's one right next to the handicap\nspace on the lighting plan so if you go\nto sheet\nbill that's\nyour just making sure that's properly\nshielded and and controlled I know\ntestimony was just provided as to trying\nto limit the the level of lighting out\n\nto low Avenue but I just wanted to\n\nindicate what kind of fixture it\nwas so that'll be the same right the\n\narts and craft style like just right\nnext to the door oh yes for when the\ntenants so they have lighting when they\nenter the building are you sure of that\nthat's the only thing I I don't mean to\nbe um I'm just trying to make sure of\nthat in other words yeah are you talking\nabout the one by the Ada correct correct\nthat's going to be the LED type that\nwill be an LED but one by the man door\nwould be more okay gotcha right but\nthat'll be a sharp cut off exture\ncorrect as far as the controls of glare\nit won't be a flood light no this is not\na FL light again it'll be a residential\nFL that's the only question I just want\nto verify questions from the\nolivo and just once again for the record\npreviously sworn remains under oath and\ncredentials were previously accepted\nthank you um can you describe to the\nboard the revisions to the Landscaping\nplan using exhibit A1 which is a colored\nrendering of sheet one of the filed\nlandscape plan just Mark\nexibit so yeah um briefly we took the\nfeedback from the board from our last\nmeeting and uh i' say the commentary was\nmostly regarding the screening from LOL\ninto the parking area so um we added\nadditional Evergreens to the greatest\nextent possible without hindering the\nsite triangle and then a lower level\nEvergreen hedge again to screen the\nparking that'll happen on the western\nside of the property um additionally\nthere was a lawn area proposed initially\nand our testimony in February right um\nso that is now populated with\n\nperennials um and there was also a\nrequest to continue the Evergreen screen\naround the property\nentirely um that was also addressed and\nthen responding to uh the environmental\ncommission had a comment about the U\nshade tree\nremoval which was addressed by John\nLinson when we initially had the plan he\nrecommended removing the large oak\ntree we then\nsupplemented with an additional shade\ntree so there are three proposed shade\ntrees um there was also some commentary\nabout non-native plants and the\nchallenge with that is of course deer\nyou know brows so we could\ncertainly make Replacements but we did\nwe do try to provide a plan that\nfunctions for the benefit of the\ncommunity as far as buffering\nEtc um I think that's all I have\nquestions from the professionals only\nquestion I have is anything invasive of\nyour plant material\nno\nokay board\nmembers okay now has Mr Linson seen this\nyes it was it was submitted in March\nprior to the um hearing that was\nsupposed to take place in April but\nthere wasn't enough members at that\n\nmeeting so it was carried so we just\ndidn't resubmit it again but it had\nalready been submitted um and it was\npart of that review in March and he\napproved it yeah I think the the report\nwe have from him was dated March 28 yes\ncorrect so I believe that reflects this\nplan Jos\nI okay any other questions from the\nboard questions from the public\nmoving on Final winess uh Michael toia\nthe\nplanner and for the last time previously\nsworn he remains under oath and his\ncredentials were accepted at the last\nyear okay so what we thought we would do\nis um just wrap up with some quick\nplanning testimony reviewing the\nvariance of that have been eliminated\nthe ones that still remain and we took a\n\nlot of notes Hillary and I did on\nsuggested conditions of approval we'll\ngo through those with you all and you're\ngoing to hear that most of the ones that\nwere suggested back on February 21st\nhave been uh Satisfied by the new plans\nokay so um first of all um as Hillary\nsaid earlier we've eliminated variances\nall signed variances are gone now there\nwere three uh suggested back in February\n10 the parkings out as a variance the\ndumpster enclosure in the residential\nZone has now been eliminated by Mr\nHollows and our overnight parking while\nstill a variance is down to four\nrequested spaces from Seven that were\noutside in the Stacked parking plan back\nin February that's uh five variances\neliminated another one moderated by the\nplan revisions um if you look up on um\n\nthe exhibit was this Mar yes this is A10\nso A10 uh this is Mr hollow's um exhibit\n\nnow we still request the D1 variance or\nuse variance for parking in the\nresidential Zone thank you um and that's\nfor the parking we've been discussing on\nthe west side of the site um this is a\nparking lot expansion across the\nresidential Zone remember we have a b\nZone in front residential Zone and back\nR six the site for 70 plus years has\nbeen used entirely uh in a commercial\ncapacity some of you should remember the\nauto upholstery business that was on the\nsite just for ages um so the D1 variance\nis to per permit commercial parking and\na residential Zone the proofs were put\non at the last hearing the main aspect\nof this case for an applicant who's only\ngetting 32 square fet of more floor area\nis modernization of the parking lot it's\n\nfinally going to be paved curved striped\nlighted buffered you finally get ad\nparking and what you heard earlier now\nis we get an organized parking lot the\ncommercial stalls will be on the\neasterly side of the lot numbering four\nand then four residential stalls down\nbelow for the apartments on the second\nfloor and then we have 1 two 3 four five\n\nemployee parking\n\nSS uh so there all going to be\n\ndesignated and organized um and this\ntakes the site finally after 70 years of\nhalfhazard commercial parking into a\nmodern parking lot particular\nsuitability test which you have to\nconsider for these D1 variances is\nobvious the parking's right next to the\ncommercial building there's no other\nsite that's more suited for the parking\nthan where it's proposed on this site\nplan we request a two variants if you\nrecall the garage at the back of the\nsite has also been there for decades\nalways associated with the business on\nthe front of the property uh we propose\na minor expansion of that garage it's on\n\nthe second floor it's 32 square ft note\nthat the main commercial building is not\ngetting bigger in any way so we're\nputting 32 square feet upstairs under a\ndormer that will match the one existing\nDormer on the site so we'll have have\nsome enhanced architecturals to the\nproperty that will enable us to\nrepresent to this board uh we will have\nno outdoor storage on the lot at all\n\nbecause of the additional storage in the\ngarage as well as existing storage on\nthe main level of that building note\nthat the garage will not increase\nemployees or traffic or be used for\ncommercial purposes other than\nstorage okay so that's the the two\nvariants um it's a very minor building\nexper um addition and in exchange we got\na vast amount of site improvements most\nnotably the buffering along the Westerly\nproperty line let's quickly talk about a\ncouple of u c variances the buffer we\npropose which Mr olivo just uh described\nis dense it's high it's Evergreen\nthere's already a big thick buffer\noffsite on the residential property to\nthe west of us this essentially doubles\nor triples the effectiveness of the\nexisting offsite buffer by providing all\nthis new plant\nmaterial the ordinance says it should be\n30 ft wide and we only propose 20 ft\nthat's the variance had we gone to 30 ft\nwe would have come smack down the middle\nof the parking lot and eliminated all\nthe new parking that I just described to\nyou and all the benefits associated with\nthat parking\nwe can do in 20 ft what the ordinance\nrequires to be done in 30 so here we\nwould represent to you the benefits of\nthe smaller buffer allow us numerous new\nspaces in an organized fashion in the\nparking\nlot uh we have a technical variance for\nlot coverage on the residential side of\nthe lot\n53.3% proposed um and we\num 24.3% is now on the site remember\nalso uh both sites now are getting\nmerged there will no longer be a\nresidential lot and a commercial lot\nit's going to be one big lot then if you\ncompared it to your B zoning uh coverage\nwe'd be compliant we think that's the\nappropriate course of action since this\nis a commercial\nlot uh Tom who was just up our applicant\nsaid he gets extremely light uh loading\nAmazon UPS FedEx occasional deliveries\nall supplies paints and so on are not\ndelivered to this site they're delivered\nto job sites elsewhere so for that\nreason we did not put a loading space on\nthe on the site plan had we done it we\nwould have lost one or two parking\nspaces we'd rather have the parking\nspaces which we know will be used on a\nnearly daily basis and recognize the\nloading is going to be that quick pickup\ndrop off like we all have our at our\nhomes when these same delivery vendors\ncome\nby finally um Mr snikes reports in in\nhis um in his report um variances needed\nfor the accessory structure that's the\ngarage he calls them technical variances\nhe's correct we need a variance for\n\nheight because of this slight expansion\nbut the Height's the same height that's\nexisted on the garage for decades 17t 7\nin we need a variance uh for dimension\nof this building 24 ft is the maximum\ndimension of any accessory building in a\nnon-residential Zone the building is 30\nft in one dimension that's existed for\ndecades so we're not changing that\neither um nevertheless it's a variance\num because we're we're expanding the\n\nbuilding and then finally we're going to\n860 sare ft on the size of that\ngarage right now it's\n828 so we're improving we're expanding\nit by a little bit the\npermitted accessory building is 576\nSquare ft remember all of our additional\nfloor area is upstairs under the eaves\nno expansion the footprint no change in\nheight uh these are all things\nreflective of the existing building and\nbear in mind all we're doing is more\nstorage upstairs which helps cleans up\nthe site all the\nmore I told you back in February our\nnegative criteria on the job uh are met\nthis is a vast Improvement aesthetically\nit's not a minor Improvement it's a vast\nImprovement buffering gets better the\ngarage becomes better looking parking\nlot becomes better looking there will be\nno on street parking um so we think\nthere's no substantial detriment to this\nI don't think I've ever worked on a job\nwhere an applicant's putting this much\nmoney into a site and only getting 32\nsquare feet out of it so The Balancing\nAct here is really positive okay um I\nwanted to talk for a couple minutes\nabout the r six Zone um it permits\nsingle family housing meaning a single\nfamily house in theory could be built on\nthe Westerly\nlot it hasn't been there for for 70\nyears plus the lot's never been used for\nresidential\npurposes despite that the intent and\npurpose of R six is single family\nhousing in this particular case though\n\nif we put a house on this lot we\nwouldn't be able to build a parking lot\nwhich benefits the B Zone at the front\nof the site we would no longer have a\nserviceable driveway out to l meaning\nall our commercial traffic would have to\ncome off of moris and no one wants that\nand we would have zero buffer between\nthe new house and the commercial site\nnot a 20ft buffer not a 30 foot buffer\nno buffer in this particular case\nbuilding housing on this site doesn't\nmake sense okay uh what makes sense is\nrecognizing the whole site has been in\ncommercial use U for 70 plus years as I\nsaid so for those reasons we think this\nis an approvable application a real\nwinner for the neighborhood and what I\nwant to do to close out um is\nquickly go through stipulations\nconditions from February 21st\num we said to you we would stipulate to\nno parking in front of the building on\nMars Avenue we now have a sign on the\nnew plan indicating that um and a sign\non the new plan saying that front is\nexit\nonly um\nwe will merge Lots three and four that's\nalready on the\nplan there will be no outdoor storage on\nthe lot that is a condition we don't\nhave a note on the plan I I believe so\nthat should be a condition no outdoor\nstorage um back in February we said we'd\nturn off all the lights in the parking\nlot at 10 p.m. recognizing lights would\nhave to stay on for the\napartments now at the back of the\nparking lot we have that motion\nsensor on a light the idea is that would\nilluminate the four residential spaces\ngo on in an as needed\nbasis if you want to say lights off at\n10 we'll still do it we think\neverything's going to work out fine\nbecause it's motion sensor the lights at\nthe Mand\ndoors um can also be motion sensor as\nTenants come into the building and go\nupstairs that's your\ncall uh we have back and forth back in\nFebruary saying add a sign to the front\nof the building that would say parking\nin\nrear uh we think that's self-evident if\nyou want that sign we'll put a sign up\nwe'll make that a condition the\ndiscussion back in February sorry\nHillary sorry um just don't keep don't\ngo back any further okay um the sign was\ntalked about being at the front of the\nbuilding facing mors Avenue um remember\nwhat our applicant said he gets almost\nno retail customers to the site which\nmeans it's basically all\nemployees and uh and Tom and his partner\nthey know where the parking is you want\nto sign we'll do it\n\num suggestion was made by your engineer\nto add curbing around the rear stairwell\nthat is now shown on the plan as our\nballards by the way and the fencing\ndescribed by Mr\nHollis storm water Cals we did\num stall 11 uh was supposed to be\nreduced down to 9 ft because it was\nenvisioned to be an employee parking\nstall now it's a commercial parking\nstall we're going to keep it at 10 ft\nwide that condition no longer applies\nfloor area ratio calculations have been\nprovided by our architect we said to you\ncommercial vehicles would be limited in\n\nheight to 7 feet meaning they would not\nbe higher than the 7 foot fence required\nby code and proposed uh by Mr alivo on\nthe site so we'll stipulate to that 7\nfeet maximum Van height um so tonight we\nheard signs for employee parking Mr\nchairman\num I want to hear what Mr snikes has to\nsay I'm not a big fan on putting up\nmultiple signs across a parking lot all\nsaying the same thing if you want what I\nwould suggest is a pavement marking that\nwould go across all of them saying\nemployee parking these stalls that way\nyou don't get the posts and the signs\nand all that your\ncall um and we'll stipulate Mr Nelson I\nthink it was no other contractors will\npark on the\nsite okay um that's it in a\nnutshell Hillary will remind me if I\nmissed anything um okay and I'll be\nhappy to answer your questions\nand Mr chairman thank you yes I would\noffer that always we try to avoid sign\nclutter try to minimize the amount of\nsigns as much as possible if we had sign\nuh labels on each one of the resident\n\nparking spaces I think that would be\n\nsufficient I've seen that successfully\ndone in the past maybe with one sign\nthat says resident parking only in that\narea so it minimizes that visual impact\num and he want he was talking about\nhaving 10 signs right well it's not what\nI heard that's why I was asking that\nquestion was it seemed like they have\nthe four signs for the four parking\nspaces for the residents and that's\ntechnically required by the rsis the\nfour parking spaces the remainder of\n\nspaces were going to be for employees\nbut I believe they were going to be\n\nassigned verbally to those people not\nnecessarily signed uh specifically um\nI'm not sure we need to have them signed\nbut that's my opinion I'd open it to the\nboard of course but uh again to avoid\nmore visual clutter this is a the\nlocation that's trying to transition\ninto a residential Zone trying to reduce\n\nthe amount of commercial look of the\narea so that would I would offer that to\nboard any other questions yeah I was\njust checking my notes I think uh Mr\nToby has definitely addressed my\nconcerns and my questions I was more\nconcerned about the outdoor storage\npotentially and he was identifying it uh\nfor the commercial uh parking spaces on\nsite one question I have for you is that\nthe four spaces at\nthat wasn't\n[Laughter]\nme the four spaces that are being\nproposed for commercial as well as the\ntwo interior they're actually located on\nthe B1 Zone portion of lot right yes\n\nokay I think that's something the board\ncan consider as well thank\nyou Mar no I have no question\ncan question for the uh planner I mean\nth this application looks fine to me\nas is for this business uh what are your\nthoughts for future use or for a\ndifferent user for this same lot we are\ntaking part from\nresidential uh zoning giving it to\nCommercial and uh so what is your uh\nfuture uh in uh prediction so right now\nas you may recall from the February\nmeeting this applicant just bought this\nproperty probably about 2 years ago the\nfuture plans are these plans okay um he\nplans on doing this he's been on the\nsite for 12 years now um he's committed\nto the site it's a local boy graduate at\nthe high school this is his gig um if\nanything comes up in the future that\nchanges this site or he wants to change\nthe site we're back before this board\nagain um to either revise uh any approv\napproval you might Grant tonight or to\ndo a whole new thing but right now the\nanswer is this is the future for the\napplicant so we're looking at like 10 20\nyears ahead thank you okay you're\nwelcome Mr chairman couple questions\nabout the parking I agree with what Mr\nsnaker said about this the signs and\nsince I was one of the ones concerned\nabout the parking and I know I think you\nalluded to this could could we Mark the\npavement instead of putting in signs is\nthat I would agree with that preferable\nyeah okay wait a minute do we have full\nagreement on something it's\namazing yeah we we like that because you\nknow I always talk it looks like\nsoldiers all lined up across a parking\nlot really looks awful it's important\nfor the residential spaces because we\ndon't want our\ntenants wondering where they're going to\npark at night so those will be signed\nand then I see one long stripe across\nthe other stalls employee parking on the\nokay speaking for myself that sounds\nreasonable I everybody else feels that\nsounds good and one other question um\nbecause I think I was one of the ones\nwho asked about the motion detector for\nyou know residents coming home when 1:00\nor 2 o'clock in the morning um is what\nyou're suggesting that it'd be on a\ntimer till 10: but that after that the\nmotion detector would be automatically\nin operation right okay\nokay yeah um couple of more like St well\nI guess questions um one of the things\nthat bothers me about business zones and\nyou had mentioned that you didn't want\ntraffic from this site entering onto\nMars Avenue every other business on that\nMars Avenue enters onto Mars appen right\none of the things that concerns me is um\nwe have side entrances from this site\ninto a it's still into the business zone\nso to say so to speak but it's a\nresidential transition zone there are\nfuture projects down the road literally\ndown the road from where this project is\nthat's going to happen in the future and\nuh I'm not against what's going on in\nthis site I'm concerned about setting\nprecedent for future construction sites\nwell if it's okay here why isn't it okay\nhere um maybe I'm being a little bit too\npicky um but I will be on the receiving\nend of one of\nthose discharges into the transitional\nneighborhood area um\nand this kind of leads into a we're\ntalking about a non-conforming site I\nthink I think part of the board's job\nhere is to bring non-conforming sites\ninto con into Conformity maybe this\nisn't the spot but I think just because\nsomething's been in use for 70 years\n\ndoesn't make it correct because it is\nnonconforming you know so I'm I'm\nI'm I like the project you guys have\ndone your team has done a fantastic job\num I was just a little taken back when\nyou said as a planner you don't want\ncars entering onto Mars Avenue that's\nwhat Mars Avenues there for so um couple\ngreat points there I'm not trying to\nargue I'm no I know\num we have the benefit of corner lot\nokay not all the Lots on Mars are Corner\nLots um one kind of planning 101 with\nCorner Lots is if you can keep traffic\noff of the Main Street meaning a\ndriveway coming out with left turns and\n\nright turns um you're better off because\nmors is busy constant flow of traffic as\nyou know whereas to make those turning\nmovements on L especially recognizing\nthat most of them are going to go to\nMars right um is the preferred planning\nalternative I wouldn't want this\ndriveway 500 feet down low right that'd\nbe a disaster but on the edge that's uh\nwhat we prefer and what the county\nprefers and what do prefers if this was\na state road your other remark um about\nnon-conforming uses generally in theory\num us planners say an old non-conforming\nuse would grow old and wither away and\nbe replaced by a conforming use but the\nlaw and practicality says that doesn't\nalways happen Okay we can't we're not\nallowed to take away non-conforming uses\nand say hit the road you know tear it\ndown and build something\nconforming this is protected by a whole\nbody of law that just focuses on\nnon-conforming uses the lead case is a\nSupreme Court case called\nBurbridge it Burbridge youve heard okay\num and what it says is if the use isn't\ngoing to fade away might as well fix it\nup that's the whole case here perfect\nexactly well and I know there are a lot\nof things going on in the tan you guys\nhave a very vibrant mhm Town um in this\nparticular site we know that building's\nnot going away um so we're trying to do\nthe best we can I think I think your\nteam's done a fantastic job yeah\nthanks if I can just add something Mr\n\nPaul maybe you can say better and I'm\ngoing to try and say it in terms of Mr\nNelson's comment about setting the\nprecedent every application is different\nso just because we approve something\nhere doesn't mean if a similar\napplication comes up two blocks down we\ndon't have to approve it there is that\nfair that's\nthanks for the education\nyeah and you would concur with the\nwitness's statements about the the case\nwould any other questions from the board\nyes sir yeah yeah I have one on the um\non the garage and the increase in the\nstorage space um this may have been\nasked but I might have missed it is um\nare there going to be any uh chemicals\nstored in that garage like um often\ntimes in the pain business there's all\nsorts of solvents being used are they\ngoing to be stored in that\ngarage um I think the testimony back in\nFebruary was they would be sto they'd be\nminimal and they'd be stored in the\nfront\nbuilding so there's going to be no\nchemical stored in that garage I mean if\nI've been in the building back there\nthat is strictly um you know ladders\nscaffolds things like that I'm just uh\npulling up my notes from the prior\nhearings the testimony was that the\nmajority of the business is non-solvent\nbased\n\nand that any solvents would be in a\nlocked storage container right the other\ntestimony on this Mr bu was basically\n\nall the applicant uses is stuff that we\ncould all buy at Home Depot uh you know\ncommercially available um supplies so I\nhope that answered your\nquestion any other questions from I'm\ngoing to try this side\nfirst and\nthis any questions from the public\nI believe you said that was your last\nwitness so I turn it over to you for\nyour summation she also said we'd be\ndone in one\nhour close I me she's got about a minute\n\nyou got okay all right well so again\nthank you for uh providing the applicant\nthe opportunity to redesign the plans\nbased on um your comments which I think\nhave resulted in a better plan than\noriginally proposed um I just want to\nhit a couple points um in closing again\nI know we've said it these two lots have\nbeen used in connection with each other\num and for commercial use for over 75\nyears the transition line between\nresidential and commercial use has\nalways been between Lot 4 and lot five\nand this application does not change\nthat but actually improves the condition\nby the addition of a planted 20ft buffer\nLot 4 has never had a single family\nresidential home on it and in all\nlikelihood never will\nif Lot 4 were to be improved with a\nsingle family home it would have a\nsignificant negative effect on the\nIngress and egress of lot three reducing\nthe commercial access driveway on lull\nto a point that would be unsafe\neffectively making it a oneway and would\nthen require Ingress and egress on\n\ntomoris Avenue it would also severely\nlimit on-site\ncirculation if Lot 4 was a residential\nlot it would also not allow for any\nbuffer area on lot three between the\ncommercial property and the new\n\nresidential home home due to the\ndriveway on L Avenue and the location of\nthe existing building so there would be\nno Landscaping Improvement at all abing\nthe residential property as a result of\n\nan Al alternative plan the tandem\nparking spots were eliminated and the\ndrive aisle increased which improves\non-site traffic circulation this\neliminates the concern for traffic jams\nin the parking area experience at this\nsite for 12 years and the proposed\nmanagement of the parking demonstrates\nthat the parking layout as proposed will\nresult in a better practice than\nexisting the plan assures that there\nwill be sufficient on-site parking for\nthis use and future commercial uses if\nthis commercial use changes and this\napplication is not approved it would\nlimit the ability to park on site\nresulting in overflow of parking on the\nstreets throughout the neighborhood the\nredesigned plan proposes two commercial\nvehicles inside the building reducing\nthe number of outside commercial\nvehicles to four where one is permitted\nand the commercial space are proposed to\nbe located completely out of view of the\nResidential Properties LOL Avenue and\nMars\n\nAvenue moving the two commercial\nvehicles in the main building makes the\n32 square ft of additional storage space\nin the garage all the more necessary so\nthat the property can be kept clear of\n\ndebris and Equipment currently being\nstored outside no neighbors have come\nout to speak in opposition of this\napplication or have raised any\n\nconcerns the applicant is making a\nsignificant investment in the Aesthetics\nof this property and this application\nprovides a realistic opportunity for the\nbeautification of the site and the area\nas a whole which benefits surrounding\ncommercial and residential properties\nthank\nyou thank you um I'm going to pick up\nsomething I forgot which is to give the\npublic its opportunity to tell us what\nthey think about this particular\n\napplication if anyone wishes\nto seeing none I believe we will move\ninto conditions\nyes uh before I list everything and I\nknow we've covered a a good portion of\nthem there with the planning testimony\nthere were two that I had still hanging\nout there one I I assume that we've\nreceived storm water management\ncalculations and you're satisfied with\nthose Marie correct okay so we can\neliminate that one the other I just want\nto confirm that the we previously\ndiscussed curbing between the commercial\nparking spaces and the building itself\nis that now added to the plans okay okay\nso we no longer need that one um so I\nnow have I think a total of seven\nconditions first is compliance with the\nconditions noted in the board Engineers\nmemorandum second there shall be no\noutside storage on the property third\nthat lights in the parking lot shall be\nturned off at 10 p.m. lights for the\nresidential spaces spaces shall remain\n\non with a motion sensor to be utilized\nfor the light closest to the residential\nspaces um fourth there shall be no\nparking in front of the garage Bay there\nshall be an exit only sign from the\nbuilding which I know we have dis uh the\nexit only sign is proposed so I suppose\nwe don't really need that um and we did\ndiscuss signage shall be added\n\nindicating parking is in the rear of the\nsite which I'll need input from the\nboard on whether we want to include that\nor not um fifth I have that the four\ncommercial vehicles to be parked on the\nsite shall be limited to commercial Vans\nor let me clarify that four commercial\nvehicles to be parked outside on the\nsite shall be limited to commercial Vans\nwith a height of not more than 7\nft sixth is that parking spaces shall\nnot be utilized by other contractors and\nseventh the applicant shall Mark the\npavement to designate the employee\nparking\nspaces and the number of votes required\nfor this five since it includes D\nvariances now I we should clarify\nsignage indicated indicating parking in\n\nthe rear of the site does the board want\nto include that as a\ncondition can I speak I I I think the\nless signs the better so I think the I\nwould say no so no parking and we I mean\nit's obvious and there's no retail\ncustomers going in that need to see that\nm w could just restate that water we're\ntime not sure follow it yeah so the\nfourth condition that we have there is\nthere shall be no parking in front of\nthe garage Bay and we previously\ndiscussed that signage shall be added\nindicating that parking is in the rear\nof the site so yeah I agree m m\ng so take out else that condition\nanybody in favor of keeping it\nin Che it out so that condition will\nonly limit that there shall be no\nparking in front of the garage bay\nperiod okay all\nright and you've heard them all so who\nwants to start Mr\nchairman I'm sorry Mr\nchairman yes sir I excuse me for\ninterjecting um regarding the commercial\nwas coming the commercial vehicle being\nparked outside should we designate\nspaces 11 through 14 in the resolution\nbecause sometimes in the future when you\nlook back at a resolution it's better to\nhave the spaces identified at least it\nhelps you as long as we're not putting\n\nit on the ground outside it's part of\nthe thing you can put it in the\npaper I was just offering I assume\nthat's AC fine okay\nhelps the record thank you okay who\nwants to\nstart now that we clarified that please\nfirst of all I think it's a thoughtful\nredesign and um you know s very\nresponsive I think to the concerns that\n\nwere laid out in the last meeting I love\nthe fact that you're preserving the\nexisting structure um I think there's\nsome options to not do that I'm glad you\nare and I think just the substantial\nimprovements to Landscaping is just\ngoing to benefit you know the town\ncertainly the neighbors um if I thought\nthere was a chance that after 70 years\nthat you know those lots would be used\nfor different purposes um I just I don't\nsee that being a feasible option so I\ncan be supportive of this and appreciate\nyour respons for\nthis anyone else down this side yeah I\nreally support this plan I think they\nIt's a Wonderful um update to the\nproperty I think I think there's all all\nall positives I mean I know there's a\nlot of variance um you know two D\nvariances and a bunch of C variances um\nbut overall I think it's you know an\nimprovement it's going to be visually\nappealing um and it's keeping you know\nit's updating and building it's not\nknocking it down and building something\nnew I think it's um highly\nsupported Mr chairman yes sir yeah this\nmight be in random where I've been\nscribbling notes Here I hope I get kind\nof in order I agree we've been very\nresponsive to our concerns definitely\nappreciate all of that I like that the\nsign variances have been eliminated I\nlike that the you reduce the number of\nvehicles can be kept outside I think the\nuse variance variances are the are\nJustified or can be granted since the\nthis use has been in place for decades\nof various kinds but I think one of the\nwitnesses said 70 years um and I I there\ncertainly no added negative impact from\nwhat's being proposed now the lighting\nVarian is the Minimus um parking\nvariances are justified by the other\nimprovements on the\nproperty\num and uh it's certainly just visually\nif nothing else it's a vast improvement\nover over what's there now um and I\nthink it's would be a very attractive\naddition to the neighborhood so I I can\nsupport it as well thank\nyou um I'm I'm really leading towards a\nquestion here for for you Mr ball um\nbecause I doo appreciate everything\nyou've done I\n\nrecognize despite my best efforts that's\nnot going to be a residential property\nin\nanybody's anybody seeing see going\nforward um but you had also said I\nbelieve back in February March\nthat if the properties are merged that\nportion of it remains residential what\nI'm thinking down the road is there a\nway to thread the needle so that if the\ncommercial IAL use of the combined sites\nare abandoned or or it is sold to\nsomebody who's doing something much\nsmaller that the residential lot can\nsomehow be reclaimed as\nresidential so they are proposing to\nmerge the lot um in theory at any point\n\nin the future they could apply for a\nsubdivision it like you said that that\nportion of the lot does remain within\nthe residential Zone unless it the uh\ncity council decides to rezone it um\nthey could apply or any other subsequent\nowner could apply for a subdivision to\nthen recreate the existing separate lot\nand it could be used as residential it\nis a process but that is the process and\nI'm I'm not sure that that aspect of it\nneeds to be incorporated into and all\nthe issues they enumerated about how\nproblematic it was be to fild Res on\nthat side for me I granted\nI believe that Mr Yuko made the\nChairman's remarks by responding to\neverything that needed to be uh put into\nthe resolution so I'm going to say based\nupon uh our past Chairman's uh remarks I\nwould entertain a motion to approve this\napplication you still oh that's a motion\nmotion to appr I thought you wanted to\nsay no okay is there a second second\nsecondos would you please call the rooll\nsure Vice chairman lit yes Mr Yuko yes\nMr Nelson yes Mr Kieran yes Mr Malay yes\nMiss to yes chairman Steiner yes the\nmotion carries thank you so much thank\nyou good\nluck um please leave the the um exhibits\nNew U new new\nexhibits her office is getting to look\nlike a really nice place inside and all\nthese drawings going there can we take a\nfast five minutes I'm sorry could we\ntake five minutes you can take four no\nyou can I can do it in four how about um\nhow about at 10 minutes before we'll\nstart okay we are in a\nkey m c k e thank you okay would you\ngive us an overview of uh what it is\nyou're planning to do and what the\nvariances are if you know them other\notherwise I see you have an expert with\nyou and I assume you'll turn it over to\nher to uh carry the what do they say\ncarry the heavy water sure um my husband\nand I have lived at nine Ed Drive since\n2003 um we have always had a covered\npatio in the back of our um property lot\nI um have learned that our house\npre-existed the setback guidelines and\nso I think we are requesting a variance\n\num for to recreate a covered porch um in\nthat same area it was um damaged and\ndestroyed when a tree fell on our\nproperty last summer during a storm so\nthe existing covered um awning was\n\nremoved and now we want to replace it\nwith a permanent structure in the same\nspot okay any questions for the\napplicant okay then uh would you\nquestions from public just to be\nquestions from the public for the\napplicant nobody wants that no okay no\n\none's going to do that okay let's move\non to your\nexpert and if you could please raise\nyour right hand do you sore airm the\ntestimony you're about to give this m\nmatters the truth the whole truth\nnothing but the truth is please state\nyour name spell your last name Janet\nseagull Janet B seagull architect\nMadison New Jersey and I know you've\nappeared before us a number of times\nhave there been any changes to your\ncredentials since the last time you were\n\nhere no there's Noone I imagine the\nboard would like to accept you once\nagain okay we can do that unless anybody\nhas an objection I don't see so let's go\nahead and move on okay\nI I'm just going to briefly explain the\num site conditions of this property um\nit is slightly undersized we're in the\nr25 zone where 25,000 ft is required\nwe're at\n20722 um and equally every neighbor that\nads them is actually in the very similar\nsize lot they're all slightly in and\naround 20,000 Square ft so we are in\nequal company um as site size um the\nfront yard setback is 35 um their\nproperty um home is 71 ft back on one\nend and 85 ft back so it is a very nice\ngracious front yard um an L-shaped home\nthat gives a very private\nbackyard um the U rear setback is 45 and\nthe um portion that um of the awning\nthat did come down and a lovely end room\nthat is more like a sun room with the\nold sleeping porch above is completely\nover the rear yard setback that's\nprobably how it was built it looks very\noriginal to the home so I don't um um so\nwhat we're doing here is just again\nreplacing what has already been in that\nspot we're also not increasing that line\nof the existing house so the high the\ntightest point of their existing corner\nis 26.3\n\nwhere we are attaching that structure is\ngoing to be 28.8 and then as the angle\nleads down it's 30.8 so we are less in\nthe setback than the existing corner but\nwe are still over that setback line one\nquestion before we forget to ask will\nthe proposed structure be the same size\nas the awning that was there very close\nyes within inches yeah we have a couple\nsquare feet um so again it's I I'm\nlooking at this as a pretty simple\nrequest um the side\num because it is the width of the\nproperty taken from this front if you\nwere taking the side yards as this end\nit is not as we are building this\nportion the proportions are taken from\nwhere that structure is built and we are\nconforming on the side yard\ncombined um but the existing home is not\nconforming on the side J any questions\non\nthat so our request basically is the one\nvariance for the rear yard set our lot\ncoverage originally when this when they\ncalled to say we need to build a new\nawning and I said I think we're you know\nover the line we asked Andrew Clark who\nhad done the survey was that on\nconsidered structural and it was not\never noted on the original survey which\nwe were kind of going back to see since\nit wasn't a secured structure it was\njust a fabric awning with a metal frame\nso we don't so we at this point the lock\ncoverage did not the original numbers\ndid not have that lot coverage or had\nthe lot coverage because there's patio\nunderneath but it did not counted as\nbuilding coverage so as we um move\nforward on the lot coverage we are\nreally only um expanding the the portion\nof that by 0 2% so a very minimal number\non how that those Dimensions came out\n\nbuilding coverage yes we are increasing\nthat's\n9 which is 189 s ft which is the size of\nthe awning or yeah the new the new\nstructure the new\ncany um the floor area not counting and\nit's not changing because we're not\nincreasing that number due to the open\narea of\nthis um the height is we are keeping it\nas a as a shed very similar to the shape\nof the awning therefore it's only\n11.2 at the highest point of the\n\nplans as I said we I don't have a\nfull floor plan of the first floor we\njust showed the area that is that lovely\nsun room that exists on the property and\nthe location of the\nnew structure and then from upstairs\nthis is an original piece and then\nyou're seeing the roof line that you\nwould be looking over from the second\nfloor the elevations this is the\nL-shaped back side view of the property\nand then you're looking at the awning as\nit's coming down on the elevation on the\n\nlower proposed side elevation and the\nrear elevation you're seeing the windows\nfrom the sun room and the sleeping porch\nabove and then the extension of the new\nawning security\nstructure I have um photos that I think\nwill be helpful if I want and I want to\num put this in as um an exhibit when\nwere the photos taken by whom and well\nthere's they're different dates they're\nnoted on here I have a date of a photo\nfrom the tree damage which is August\n2023\nI have a photo that I took in January\n2024 with no awning it had been\nremoved um this is an existing view I'm\nnot sure who took it it was the real\nestate listing from 2002 which does we\nwanted to show that that awning\nstructure was there in 2002 and then\nthis is taken U by Liz I believe in June\nof 2022 again showing the awning in use\nso various dates but again a good\num I just have copies if you want thank\nyou for that but I think this was just a\ngood example of um kind of trying to\ndate when when they bought the house\nthis is prior to their ownership on the\nreal estate that this was Thea that's\nwhat we're trying to show here that and\num in our proportions what we're trying\nto do is keep that same shape and size\nand use um basically we're putting just\na Sonu structure so we're really not\neven affecting the patio underneath so\nit's very minimal\nconstruction um like for like\nsize um and most importantly a very\nsecure structure obviously the awning\njust crumbled with the tree um we're\n\nhoping for more safer structure also the\nawning was something they had to take up\nand down as the season went out so this\nwill be a permanent um minimal sight\ndisturbance as I just said visually\nattractive and um the\ninteresting or on the next exhibit\nin the neighborhood I'm just going to do\na really Bri brief rundown as you look\nat our tax map and you look at this\ncircle from Edgewood Road to Edgewood\nDrive it's like a kidney shape as a pool\nas you go around every view as I drove\nand took pictures of the front of each\none of these houses is looking up so the\nback of everyone's property as we're\nlooking at the rear yards is the peak of\nthis hill so it's a very private spot\nthere's no way to see where this\nstructure is and actually hard to see it\nfrom anywhere from their property\nbecause of the buffering at the top of\nthat dild that everyone has kind of at\nthe peak planted a nice row of buffering\nso it's a very interesting site\num kind of topography of what's\nHappening as you look up everyone's yard\nyou're looking up on that whole\nbeautiful homes you're in the tutor side\non one side on the other side of that\nyour drive you have all Colonials so um\nwe're just keeping you this is a good\nupkeep it's a nice way of keeping these\nhomes in beautiful condition the only\ncomment I believe we had from\nengineering there's very little um sight\ndisturbance um and at the point when\nwe're at that top there's very little\nslope difference of of at the back of\nthe yard there's very little slope\nchange and we're not even changing the\npatio um there was a comment from\nhistoric um\npreservation the option to use copper is\nin their wheelhouse we haven't done all\nthe pricing but that is the goal to have\nthe copper because they will be looking\nout the window from the second floor you\nknow onto that copper roof and again you\nhave some options with this house with\nthe slate roof and the you know and a\nmetal roof I think our first goal was to\n\ngo with um I think the metal and staying\nat at three on 12 slope to get that\nwater off but also keep it down as a\nminimal on the impact and then keeping\nwith what they were used to um in their\nprevious um just technically we should\nwe mark this is A1 and the second one is\nA2 2 and A3 yes yeah the these pictures\nwere marked as A1 and this was I have V2\nso that would be that would be A2 and or\nwell one of them would be A2 and the uh\nthe one that's hanging in the middle\nthere is A3\nA3 all right just to\nbe just to keep the record going\nso we have worked uh you know again\nwe're don't think this is going to be\ntoo heavy of an Ask we're trying to\npresent a structure that's going to be\nin keeping with the style um in in the\nmetal and um and black detailing as many\nof the tutor homes have and then just um\nworking within the beautiful\nneighborhood that's there and staying in\nthe scope of what the town is asking for\nand the zone and not asking for any more\nthat's already been there and U feel\nthat we've met those needs if you have\nany other questions okay we'll start\nquestions with our\nprofessionals Mar I so I I as you heard\num there's a minimal increase in um in\n\nprvious coverage on the property I think\nI noted 36 square fet does that sound\nright because the patio is already there\nand we're just going over the patio\nwhere where those footings are going is\nslightly increasing that right so as a\nresult you know that doesn't really\ntrigger any um storm water mitigation on\nthe property doesn't appear that there's\nany um changes to the topography so we\n\ndon't have any we don't take any\nexception to the to the\ndesign head uh no questions thank you\nokay board members just a minor one Mr\nchairman yes sir so I see you have your\nsidey yard combin it nonconforming\n35.7% for some reason you've\nlisted entirely\ndifferent percentage in your\nproposed and I understand you took those\nDimensions from a different point yes\nright can you explain yes I that why the\ncase a good point um this was with um\nwith Christa Anderson and how she\ninterprets when there's um a as opposed\nto taking the changes from here if you\ncan see what I'm talking about those are\nthe two numbers we were talking about\nthe two tightest numbers when we're\ndoing an addition back here she actually\nhad me take the two numbers that is\nreference from where that addition is\ncoming from really that's just her\ninterpretation I've done it with her\nthat way before so it um and it does yes\ndramatically change that number and it's\nhard to reconcile existing and propose\nbecause it's a very different\nit you could also take that same point\nwithout the awning here possibly might\nmake a little more\nsense but I looked at the most extreme\nfirst as the non-conforming and then\nright that's where you're traditionally\nsupposed to take the sidey yard combined\nset back\nmeasurements okay so just curious would\nyou take that right corner and the new\ncorner I I would say you just keep the\n35.7\nand call it existing nonconforming call\nit a day but okay we don't we don't dare\ngo against\nKristen Christa has\nretired yeah we'll train the next one\nright so she's even more exalted I don't\n\nyes okay but I mean but the fact I\nunderstand she's still still in the\noffice on her days but the fact is I\nmean however we calculate it it's still\n\nit's no difference in appearance or\nright yeah yes it's a very adir but\nknowing moving forward is why I'm asking\nI do agree and then is it your testimony\nthat due to the slope of the front yard\nthere is no practical other place to\nbuild the house and that and although as\nyou said um the the setback rules\nchanged since the house was built I mean\nall the houses are forced to the back of\ntheir property yes that little quadrant\nof of homes as you look at\num this group right here they are this\nthese five right here are have pretty\nextreme slopes as you come up so they\nare are moved the back so\nyes other\nquestions I just have a question on the\num footings for the um the covered porch\nMH what are they going to I mean what I\nsee the picture but what color are they\ngoing to be I mean they going to is it\nI'm just concerned I mean it's a\nbeautiful historic home will it how are\nyou making it so that it looks like it's\nbeen there footings I'm talking about\n\nwhat's going in the ground oh yeah no\nI'm talking about the The Columns we are\nlooking at um doing all in a wood but a\ndark stinging and then doing the copper\nso generally as in a lot of the tutors\nhave the dark trim that's kind of the\nidea so it kind of if you also see what\nwas there was rod iron and we're not\ngoing there so it was sort of a mixture\nof keeping it very clean okay and having\nthose Lin trying to modernize it to so\nit's your testimony that the\narchitectural style of this cedy will be\nin keeping with the architectural style\nof the house yes\nokay thank\npublic seeing none\num does anybody from the public wish to\ntell us what they think of this\nparticular proposal\nokay uh then we will move to\num anything you'd like to say in\nconclusion no just thank you for uh\nconsidering this update we think it's\ngoing to be a nice Improvement to the\nhome conditions and number of votes yep\njust are one condition compliance with\nthose conditions noted in the board\nEngineers memorandum and since it's only\none single C variance uh four votes\nwould be required okay who would like to\nstart I this is an easy yes um you're\nreplacing what was there the backyard is\nextremely well um buffered from the\nneighbors even the photo from the winter\num makes it hard to see anything through\nthose trees and like last weekend it was\nall greened in um so yes um let let the\nMcKees have their shade I'm in favor of\nthis okay yeah and me me too I think I\nthink the proposal is more attractive\nthan uh than the awning and just to\nconfirm what Miss to just put on the\nrecord that the Forester concluded that\n\nit's very well screened and and no need\nfor anything of that nature so I can\nsupport it as well any others comments\nfrom anyone if not I think uh this is as\nthey say an easy an easy lift uh it's\nsomething we uh we can look at all the\nnegatives and there aren't any and then\nwe can look at all the positives and say\nthere they are uh we can just uh move\nforward and uh I would entertain a\nmotion to a so moveed\nsecondos Vice chairman lit yes Mr Yuko\nyes Mr Nelson yes Mr Kieran yes yes Mr\nMalay yes Miss to yes chairman Steiner\nyes the motion\ncarries thank you okay we move on\nto Brian and Renee odonnell 22\n[Applause]\nall right I can get you sworn in if\nyou'll raise your right hand do you\nswear airm the testimony you're about to\ngive in this matter is the truth the\nwhole truth nothing but the truth I do\nplease state your name spell your last\nname Renee odonnell o d o n n e l l\nthank you okay if you would explain to\nus what uh what you're attempting to do\nhere and what the variances are if you\nknow them and uh uh then go ahead and uh\nwe'll ask you any questions but uh turn\nit over to your expert great um so again\nI'm Renee odonnell my husband Brian and\nI have been living at 22 Webster Avenue\nfor seven years now uh we always knew we\nwanted to live in Summit and actually\nclosed on our home about 2 months after\ngetting married um we absolutely love\nthe neighborhood that we live in many of\nour neighbors have been improving their\nhome so that they can stay in our\nneighborhood and we feel the same way we\nwanted to wait a a little while to\nensure we made the best changes for the\nhouse possible so that we could stay\nthere for a long time 20 or 30 years um\nwe are proposing um a front porch which\nis one of the variances for the front\nsetback um but then most importantly we\nare requesting an addition in the back\nwhich would allow us to um expand our\nhome at a mudro drop zone better\nbathroom area uh for downstairs and then\nEXP upstairs to include a fourth bedroom\num in the for the potential of an\nexpanding family and those variances\nthat we would be requesting for that um\n\ninclude lot coverage and building\ncoverage and floor area\nratio okay um I'm just going to ask are\nyou planning to say anything tonight no\nI okay because if you are we'll swear\nyou in just just in case you happen to\ndrop a comment in okay uh any questions\nfor the applicant I have one just CU I'm\ncurious um there was a note somewhere in\nthe in the package about the lot having\nbeen divided in the '90s\ndo you know what did it look like\nbeforehand um yes so we've been told by\nour neighbors uh we we've had they are\nno longer on our block anymore but we\nhad several neighbors that had been\nthere across the street from us that\nhouse is no longer there and it's now a\nbrand new house but the owner there his\nwife was the original owner um and then\nthree houses down somebody was also grew\n\nup on the Block um it was our house and\nthe lot next door was all one lot we\nwere told and there was a green house on\nthe other lot and the driveway actually\nwent um what is our current family room\nwas a garage and the driveway came out\nfrom the garage and snaked behind the\nwhole property and dumped out onto\nmontros is what we were told and then\nthey divided the lot sold off the second\nhalf and a house was put there by a\nbuilder\nokay any other questions for the\napplicant you have not any questions\nfrom the public for the\napplicant see any questions from our\nexperts NOP we will then uh I assume you\nhave an expert with you and uh we'll\nswear you in and go from there do you\nswear from the testimony you're about to\ngive in this matter is the truth the\nwhole truth and nothing but the truth\nyes I do please state your name spell\nyour last name Robert Forbes f o r\nbees thank you and have you uh testified\nbefore the board yes I have recently uh\nwithin the last year yes all right any\nchanges to your credentials since the\n\nlast time you were here no I imagine the\nboard would like to accept you once\nagain yeah we will\ncertainly okay great thank\nyou all right so just to uh start off um\nthis is 22 Webster AB as R mentioned\nit's lot 11 uh block 503 it's in the R6\nZone it's\n7,809 Square ft it was originally built\nin\n1933 um as I kind of walk you through\nthe plans we'll kind of see how it has a\nlittle bit of a quirky floor plan part\nof what Rene said is how the it was\noriginally a garage so it's almost feels\nlike a split level when you're inside\nand the second floor is um very clipped\nup Brian as you can see is not a small\nperson behind me he has a little trouble\nup on the second floor um we have kind\nof some existing non-conforming coverage\nsituations that um make this addition a\n\nlittle bit challenging from a from a\ncoverage Point um a lot of it is due to\nthis um oversized two-car detached\ngarage in the rear of the property um I\ndon't get the benefit of taking the full\ncredit for that garage from a floor area\nstandpoint so there's some leftover um\nF that's in that garage um if I if that\nwas only a onecar garage or was within\nthat 288 square feet the F variance\nwould actually go away um so the the\nmass of the main building as I kind of\nwalk through this um we really feel as\ncompatible with what the f is trying to\nbe in the neighborhood and I feel like\nthat's important to kind of start state\nfrom the start here um and as you can\n\nsee there's kind of this little recess\nin the back of the lot and we feel like\nthat recess really hides that oversized\ngarage and really helps to absorb that\nextra bulk um so it's hard to see\nanother thing is because of that big um\ngarage that's recessed back there we\nhave a long driveway right so I get\nextra loot covers that I'm already\nexisting nonconforming at um which I'll\nkind of walk you through as we go\nthrough the plans so we have these this\nkind of existing non-conforming lock\ncoverage and we also have existing\nnon-conforming building coverage all\nkind of generated a little bit by this\noversized garage um and its placement so\nI just want that to be noted from from\nthis um we are proposing a very small um\nmudroom Edition in the back which is\nright\nhere it's 140 square ft it helps us to\njust as I kind of show you the plans\nhelps us to just get access to the\nbuilding from the back let's us set up\nthe rest of that old garage as a family\nroom and make a better connection to the\nkind of the kitchen living area that's\nactually up a few steps um which I'll\nkind of walk you through the other um\nnew building coverage is the front porch\nwhich we feel like is really compatible\nwith some of the other front porches\nthat are happening one one right to the\nright of us one right across the street\nfrom us um I did I do have an exhibit\nwhich I'll walk you through in a moment\num that also um we are not getting very\nwe are heading a second floor but we are\nnot not pushing towards that 35 ft Max\nheight the existing building is at 28 ft\nand we're only proposing to go to 30 ft\nI feel like that's important the the\nneighborhood kind of sits in that kind\nof height and we're trying to kind of be\nresponsive to that um I'm kind of\n\nexcited about this project I feel like\num the house needs a little bit of a\nfacelift and um I think we've kind\nachiev that and made it more compatible\nwith the other Colonials on the\nstreet um so I kind of walked you\nthrough the survey as I was sitting\nthere go over to sheet\nb82 U this is the first floor plan this\nis what was included in your packet um\nthis area in the back here is the\nmudroom addition that we are adding just\nkind of giving us better access from\nthat rear driveway it's all over\nexisting covers that's already cover\npatio right now there's no new coverage\nlot coverage being created by this\nmudroom okay you can see how the house\nis kind of divided this side is higher\nthan this side it's up about four steps\nso this is a very quirky part of the\nhouse where we're trying to create a\nbetter connection to this B room and\nadding this mudro is allowing that the\nthe front porch in the front here is\nreally the only new impervious coverage\nthat's being created and you think great\nbenefit to the neighborhood from the\nforch as I as I mentioned other than\nthat we're really renovating the kitchen\ncleaning up this rear um old Sun ports\nhave been previously enclosed to create\nan office um for them to work from\nhome that's really other than inter you\nknow interior kind of moving some stuff\naround cleaning know what's going on\nbefore you move on to the next page the\nleft corner here yeah is is that new\nthat's a new box window that's in the\nback in the back oh this yeah that's\nexisting already exting\nI think it was like an or something yeah\non the proposed that has an X through it\nI thought that was something\nnew it re is that what yeah I couldn't\nread but that said\nyeah it's it's it's just probably\npartial to getting that's to actually\nmake this yeah it's not level with the\nrest of the house it's got the old\nso as we come up to the second\nfloor um you can see really these dotted\nlines that are in there that's the\nexisting knee walls that are really low\nthere's one bedroom here existing and\nthere's two bedrooms over here we're\nreally just renovating again lifting um\nthe facade lifting the exterior walls\neverything is conforming to the setbacks\nI think that's also important to not\nhere um we are having a little walk up\npadic to a little finish storage space\nup there all that is under height\ndoesn't count as\nF\num4 we have the front facades these\ndotted lines represent the existing\n\nbuilding that dotted line there\nrepresents the existing orig line so you\n\ncan see we really just you know\nextending those vertical walls all\nwithin the setbacks but the height of\nthe building is not getting much taller\nand I feel like that's important to be\nkind of compatible in that neighborhood\nkind of you know we're not trying to\npush to that 35t height you can see the\nnew front porch we feel it really helps\nto kind of scale the building back down\ninto the neighborhood create a sense of\ncommunity that has a great neighborhood\nkids running around the\nneighborhood like hanging out in the\nfront\nare that's the right side elevation this\nis that very clipped up area that we're\nas we come to the rear facade this is\nthat existing structure that's really\nkind of being cleaned up and rebuilt\n\nthat's noted um on the rear this is the\nthe new area of the mud room which has a\nsecond for on the top of it this is the\nleft side\nelevation and then I have this exhibit\nI that I put together today I saw in\nChris's in Chris's um notes or was a\nnote about doing a neighborhood\naveraging um so I put that together\ntoday um I kind of tagged here on a tax\nmap a b b is the site c d and e um are\nall kept on our side and then I took the\nthree closest across the way like we're\nsupposed to I get an average of\n23.7 ft just a little closer than the 25\nft but not not at the 20. that we're\nproposing however I did want to note oh\n\nI should Mark this right want we to mark\nthis A1\nplease however I I wanted to note the\nthe house to the right of us right flag\nis\nC okay which is here which is 24 Webster\nhas a front porch and that's noted there\nand that has a setback of 19.5\nalso across the way a newer build that\nwas that was done um site H which is 25\nWebster also has a new front porch which\nis at\n21.5 next to that\ng is the only other one that has like a\nptico that pushes forward is at uh 23\nWebster is at 24 so all of the sites\n\nthat have front porches or front\nporticos start to push close to that\nthat we're proposing and what I did in\nthis aerial shot that I took today off\nof Google is I wanted to try to draw a\nline showing from the front porch next\nto us if I drew a line\nstraight you can see where that area\nwhere we're putting our front porch\nwe're not going to be the closest thing\nto the street I feel like we're very\ncompatible with our neighbor very\ncompatible with what's going on I feel\nlike that's unfor this is just some\n\npictures that I took when we first\nstarted the project um back in these\nphotos were taken October\n27th um just before Halloween Brian\nwanted me to mention that his spider\nspider um so photo a is at the front of\nthe house photo B is at the back of the\nhouse this is where that mother magici\nis going you can see all this coverage\nthat's already existing there um and\nphoto C is of the left side of the house\nthis is that structure that you're\nasking about that's being let me ask a\nquestion why I've got the pictures there\nand I I visited the property today and I\nforgot to confirm this although I have\nno reason to doubt that the zoning\nofficer's comment about the Google Earth\npicture is is wrong you have the you\nhave the HVAC unit in the front of the\nhouse and it's not screened so there is\nan HVAC unit front of the house that uh\napparently was not on the original\n\nsurvey because there was some heavier\nLandscaping there that it was hiding it\nas we build the porch we have to move\nthat AC compressor so that AC compressor\nwill get relocated as part of conru\nwhich I think is to either conforming\nlocation and screened and all that good\nstuff it'll be\ntoo and I I know you mentioned this\nearlier but I didn't hear you attach\nnumbers to you you were addressing the\nimpact of the oversized garage on the\nF did were we able to quantify that just\nI know you said it it's a part of the\ndri drove the variant but how much of it\nis the oversiz garage so 136 square fet\nof the\ngarage is not counted is not credited to\nthe F that represents\n1.74% our F deviation is\n1.7% okay so you would be slightly I\nwould actually if I built a 288 foot\ngarage I would be able to remove my f\nVAR okay um which is I think important\nto know and again I feel like the site\ncan absorb it because of this little\nspecial Niche that it has in the back\nyou can almost see from the aerial how\nkind highs back there um it's not really\nvisible and I think and then the the\nmass of the mean struct\nreally is compatible with the zoning\nwhich I think is important that's what\n\nyou visually see from the street\nschap\num that's that's\nreally it for my testimony other than\nquestions\nokay questions from Marine no I have no\nquestions just a quick question\nregarding the second floor is indicated\nthat that will conform with all the\nsetbacks the second floor conforms with\nall of the setbacks so it's really just\nthe the front porch that's calling for\nthe front yard setback there the front\nporch is the only setback there that\nwill remain open that will remain open\nyes okay thank you no further\nquestions okay questions from the\nboard just have a question on uh on\ndrainage\num when I was out there um you I'm\ntrying to hear you when I was at the\nproperty it looks like the the drainage\nfrom the whole back back side of the\nroof is running into 4 in PVC pipes\nrunning under the driveway and it's\nrouted out through the side of the\ngarage and there was a black corrugated\npipe which actually runs almost to the\n\nend of the property I got to imagine\nthat that runoff has got to be going\ninto neighbor's yard is that is there\nany kind of a drainage pit on that\nproperty or\num there is not a drain that we know we\ndo have a black corrugated pipe uh that\nwe actually angled at plants it may have\nbeen moved because my son loves to play\nwith it um but we where it was dumping\nonto our property was causing runoff of\num Mulch and stuff and sediment to kind\nof run down onto our neighbors property\nso we used the pipe to uh funnel it at\n\nthe hostas that are there and kind of\nlike have some water we've never had\ncomplaints from our next door neighbor\nor the neighbor behind that there were\nany water issues from it um but that was\nour solution at the time but we have\nthere as we're as we've been told or\nknew of there were no dra like um Wells\nput in but with with this addition AR\nthey increasing uh some roof area which\nis going to cause more they're\nincreasing it um by a small amount um I\nthink it was 188 138 Square ft which\ndoes not trigger any um need for any\ndrainage improvements on the property\n\nany dry\nWells so they're not required to do\nanything other questions from the\nWitnesses now do you have any other\nwitnesses that you brought\nno\nokay um we've asked the public if they\nhave any questions for this\nwitness okay seeing none uh are there is\nthere anyone from the public that would\nlike to tell us what they think of this\napplication\nformer board member course if you could\nplease raise your right hand do you\nswear from the testimony you're about to\ngive this matters the truth the whole\ntruth nothing but the truth yes please\nstate your name spell your last name\nsure Elizabeth new and\nW 26 Webster Avenue I am in complete\nsupport of this project um it's in\naccordance to all the other products on\nour streets on Madison on Evergreen um\nand then you know it's just keeping in\nthe same gist of the properties the\nfront porches that are coming about I\nwish I can have one\n\ntoo um but it it's will be a beautiful\nEdition um especially for the backyard\nfor the kids uh I think uh totally in\nsupport of\nit okay thank\nyou anyone else wish to tell us what\nthey think of this particular\napplication\nseeing none if you have any closing\nremarks uh just thank you all for your\ntime and thank you for being on this\nboard um it's important work you do and\nit's a lot of big time commitment so\n\nthank you and thank you Stephanie for\nall your help with the application\nprocess so appreciate your\ntime conditions and number of votes y\nonce again our only condition is our\nusual one compliance with those\nconditions noted in the board Engineers\nmemorandum uh this does include a d\nvariance for f so five votes would be\nrequired to\napprove Okay who wants to\nbegin Mr Vice chairman you look like\nyou're\nR thank you Mr chairman I was wavering\nuntil Miss n step to the Dez now I'm\n100% in favor of this\nproject no\nI I think all these\nimprovements\num in totality the the\npositives positive criteria outweighs\nthe negative it's a substantial\nImprovement to the design the use uh\nprobably the safety of the\nhouse U I believe it's entirely\nreasonable request to have this front\nporch which violates the front yard set\nback it's the juice is wor\ncertainly going to\nbe\nworthwhile incursion into the front yard\nso with all that I can wholeheartedly uh\nsupport this\napplication Mr yuku yeah I I I came into\n\nthis little somewhat concerned because\nof the large F uh variance request um\nand I appreciate the clarification on\nthe garage that that kind of kind of\nhelp me understand where some of that\nwas coming from and you know that's an\nexisting garage and that's you\nknow uh so that's understandable and I\nalso appreciate and I'm glad you were\nasked to do the front yard averaging\ncalculation because that also helped\naddress some of the concerns I had\nbecause it it you know visually it\nlooked like it wasn't going to be it was\ncomparable to the other front porches\nbut your calculations help give me\nComfort on that um you know it's\ndefinitely a very positive Improvement\nto the to the property um and it's as\nhas been noted it's in line with what\nsome of your neighbors have done um so\nin spite of some initi reluctance um\n\nthat your testimony your calca helps I I\ncan support it as\nwell I too can support this um front\nporches help build community that's\nconsistent with the master plan master\nplan also speaks to sort of a visual\nhistoric coherence throughout town just\ngetting rid of those fake stones in the\nfront of your house is worth the price\nof admission um I also appreciated the\narchitect's drawing showing how W with\n\nthe overlay of the roof lines you've\ncleaned up a lot of the roof lines\nyou've cleaned with the\n\nfenestration um and that that's in\naccordance with all the design\nguidelines so it's you know little small\nchange big impact I can certainly\nsupport\nthis anyone on this side they theyve\nmonopolized\nall the point any any other question any\nother\ncomments now it looks like\nuh Miss n carried the\nno\nuh you're right there are a few\nnegatives but they're well overpowered\nby the positive so at this point we\nwould uh accept a motion to approve the\napplication so moves second\nMiss suos\nsure Vice chairman loid yes Mr Yuko yes\nMr Nelson yes Mr Kieran yes Mr Malay yes\nMiss toad yes chairman Steiner yes the\nmotion\ncarries congratulations good luck you\nthank you and follow everything on the\n[Applause]\nnext\nthat's um while they Tabit yes I was\ngoing to say while they are settling in\nI don't know what point they'll be out\nof the way in a minute yes I don't know\nat what point this is appropriate\nbut could we consider taking judicial\nnotes notice of the the tax map not\nreflecting the reality on the ground\nspecifically neither Washington Nur\nGrove really Connect middle to Broad\nStreet um there's a creek down the\nmiddle there's significant undergrowth\nand this property in reality is not it\nit backs up to undergrowth and other\nbackyards it does not back up to Grove\nStreet yes can can wait till we get the\nwitness that the applicants warn in and\nthen we can do the whatever discussion I\ndon't know in what order this happens I\n\nI'd just rather have it all on the\nrecord of the of the of the application\nand they can respond to it and we can go\nfrom there\n\nokay okay please if you could please\nraise your right hand do you swear from\nthe testimony you're about to give in\nthis matters the truth the whole truth\nnothing but the truth yes please state\nyour name spell your last name my name\nis Elizabeth tavit T is in Tom a v is in\nVictor i t is in Tom thank you okay um\nif you can just give us a quick overview\nand then we'll get\ninto uh the issues that\nuh come up and maybe your expert will\nhave some answers to it sure um my\nhusband opened a retail business in\nSummit I think around 20201 which is why\nwe moved out here and we bought this\nhouse in 20 2004 deliberately we wented\na double family home for long-term\ninvestment we lived there for 3 years\nand we\nmoved in 2007 to 22 brainer Road where\nwe currently\nreside um we have had a lot of success\nas a rental property um it's been a\nreally great property for\nus we would like to add this addition to\n\nthe second floor to sort of bring the\nproperty into the 21st Cent if we could\num improve the quality of just the way\nthings look there um hopefully um\nattract tenants who will value the\nproperty and care for\nit um we plan to hold on to the property\nuh maybe my daughter might move in there\nsomeday we're also considered the\ndreaded downsizing we may move in there\nthe first floor um has no um stairs or\nanything so we are considering for\nretirement home so um we\nare you know just we're very committed\nto Summit we live here we don't plan to\ngo anywhere else you whether stay in\nthis house that we live in now or move\ninto this property someday and I'd like\nto introduce my witness whose name is\nAran he's an architect he's our\narchitect okay questions for the\n\nthe\n\nexperts questions from the\npublic please come\nforward my name is marij makuchi defonso\nI am a manager for Mochi makuchi realy\nHoldings um I reside at 12 Washington\nAvenue my house at 14 is in LLC my\ndaughter resides at 73 Springfield\nAvenue that is also in LLC and my mother\nresides 71 springield thato so my family\nhas owned this property these four\nLots no we're looking for questions at\nthis point okay only questions to the\napplicant I'm reading this um little\nwrite up here um combined side yard set\nback their side I think that will be\nprobably answered by the expert better\nbefore than the applicant because that's\nwhat he's here for is to go through all\nthe statistics I don't understand how a\nsidewalk justif a a sidey yard it's a\nsidewalk that's maybe I don't know two\nthree they'll get to that question and\nthen there's a a foot patch of grass on\nthe side and that's it and on the other\nside there's the brook and ma'am this is\nquestions\nquestions they got to give them a chance\nto answer it when the proper witness\ncomes\nup I don't and their proper witness is\n\nnot here right now I don't understand\nthe com combined sidey yard there is no\nsidey yard okay that's it we'll explain\nthat to youy a sidey when there is a\nokay ma'am we'll explain it to you but\nyou have to give us back the floor\nokay thank you\nokay now you have a witness with you to\nexplain sure my witness is Art hen he's\nU the architect for the project okay if\nyou could please raise your right hand\ndo you swear from the testimony you're\nabout to give on this matter is the\ntruth the whole truth nothing but the\ntruth please state your name spell your\nlast name arthor H\nhnn thank you and can you briefly\ndescribe your background and experience\nfor the board sure um I've been\npracticing for architecture for 23 years\nbeen before this board a number of years\nago I think twice um quite a while ago\num most recently Lyon and Cranford um my\nLIC good\nstanding license in New Jersey I imagine\nthank you any questions from the board\nwould you like to accept his credentials\nwe'll take your credentials and assume\nthat you will uh in your presentation\ntry to\nanswer uh the question of the the Varan\n\nthe public that please okay uh so we're\nhere for two variances uh the first one\nis for lot area uh for an existing two\nfamily home where 10,000 square ft is\nrequired and we currently have\n9,498 square ft uh which is 5502 Square\nft below the required uh lot area uh the\nexisting home was built in the 1970s as\na two family home and bought by the\ntavits in 2004 as a two- family home uh\nthere are six six of the 11 homes on\nthat Dead End Street uh Washington\nAvenue are two family homes and five of\nthose uh two family homes on that street\nuh are less than the 10,000 s foot um\nkind of goes to um uh board M was\n\ntalking about is that being a dead end\nStreet um on the TX map it looks like\nWashington Avenue continues through but\njust past the tabs property it's a dead\nend there's a um what we call a drainage\nditch that kind of cuts the road\num you know right here at the right\nthere and gr Street doesn't continue\nthrough at back corner the back of\ncorner of the property is a dead end\nthere too you kind of see that um\n\non their survey we kind of see the end\nof a Grove stopping here and the rest of\ntheir back of their property is\nbasically uh that drainage ditch and a w\nwooded\narea um it's important to note\num we talk about the um you know the\nrear\n\nyard um you know given the fact that\nthere's you know multiple two family\nhomes you I'm not feeling and they're\nallowed in that R5 Zone\num I think requiring the owner to\nconvert it into a one family zone or one\nfamily home uh to comply with the 5,000\nfoot requirement for of one family would\nbe an undue hardship for them um the\nother variance is the combined sidey\nyard\nsetback uh\n33% um 16 1 12 ft total of the um is\nrequired uh we currently have\n\n29% which is a combined setback of 14.5\nuh which is an existing condition that\nwe're not\nchanging um the combined side setback\nregarding the yard uh The Yards it's the\ndistance from the house to the property\nline whether there's a sidewalk or\nPaving there the measurement is from the\nhouse uh to the property\nline the proposed second floor that\n\nwe're uh looking to do on on the house\num all falls within and complies with\nthe side guard setbacks um so that that\nmass that we're putting on the back um\nFalls within those\nsetbacks um the left side of the house\nwhich is the garage side is that portion\nhas uh puts us over that combined side\nour set back by about 2 feet um reducing\nthe garage\nwidth it's over on this\nside reducing that garage withd um would\nbasically make that garage\nunusable um there's currently phut there\nan 8ot door on there uh so I think that\nyou know for cents would be a hardship\non that\num just for um you know conversation the\ndistance from the left side of our house\nto the neighbor on the left is 20 28 ft\nI took a laser and measured the distance\nso we got 28 ft from house to house and\non the right hand side where we're\ncloser where we can't we comply on that\nright hand side is 15\nfoot n in is from house to house so even\nthough we don't comply on the left side\n\nwe're still a greater distance from\nhouse to\n\nhouse um the next portion of this\npresentation I'm going to kind of touch\non um the zoning officer's uh comments\nin her in her report so there's some\ndiscussion again about that through lot\num because it's basically a grow Street\nleic have paper Street and unapproved at\ntheir back it would be consider through\nlot but visually in the way it\nfunctions a it's a rear yard um I don't\nforesee that ever being improved that\nthat drainage uh ditch you know you can\nsee that the survey comes across and\neventually kind of goes down through\nthat paper Street of of\nRo um but analyzing if you you know\nconsider a through lot um the 40% of a\nlot depth um the proposed addition would\nstill fall in into that requirement so\nwe would be fine there the only thing\nthat um she brought to our attention is\nthere's a a metal shed in that back\nright hand corner of the property um we\ntalked about you know bringing it into\ncompliance we'd have to move it forward\ncloser to the house by about 11 ft uh in\nfrom the property line on the right hand\nside by about 3 ft um then when I went\nthere again just kind of looked at it\nclose\nI realized it was pushed all the way\n\nback in the right hand\ncorner um you had that drainage ditch so\nso where it is kind of makes sense um we\ncould probably pull it away from that\nproperty line on the right hand side a\nlittle bit but back in that right hand\ncorner makes the most sense uh would\ntake less impact with the backyard\num so\num you know that existing shed was\nplaced there by the current tenant and\nyou know we're looking at you know some\nfrom comments from the board you know we\nwant to move that but before we move on\nMr Paul so for variance purposes should\nwe treat this as a through lot or not I\nmean visually and practically it's not a\nthrough lot but it sounds like legally\nit is yeah technically I believe the way\nit's defined in the ordinance result in\nit being a through lot and so to that\nextent yes some leeway can be given if\nwe want to Grant the variances from\nthose existing additional conditions\nthat were noted in there um but I I'll\ndouble check as we continue but I do\nbelieve we should treat it as a through\nlot is\ndefined and if we do you know if we do\nthat then I can adjust the the uh the\nrear guard stepb back lines and and you\nonly you know like said the proposed\naddition would still be in compliance\nwe're basically going on top of existing\nfirst\nFlor um Point number two uh that zoning\nofficer brought up was regarding the the\nroof pitch U it required to be six on 12\num our house currently has a 4 on2 pitch\num in the proposed addition we're just\nbasically um you know matching that to\nbe uh in conformance with and kind of be\nunified with the uh the existing\nstructure uh the house to the right uh\nof our property looks like basically\nidentical house just the the roof was\nturned probably a very similar pitch\nmost of the houses in that neighborhood\nyou have a similar uh you know aesthetic\nand a similar height\num on the front of the house we did make\nsome improvements to the front the side\num even though the bulk of our work is\nto the back with that addition uh we\nwanted to dress up the front and you\nknow increased the curb appeel we added\na skirt roof U with a Gable over the\nfront door and a gable roof at the at\nthe upper roof line and that upper roof\nuh uh Gable has a pitch of um of kn on\n12 so even though the existing structure\nis 4 on 12 and the intent to to leave\n\nthat existing structure 4 on 12 the\nelements that we are adding are going to\nhave a steeper pitch to\nit um\nwe just talking about the elev see that\non the front pitch over that little fox\nthat we're putting on and the G it's all\na 6 on 12 and the rest of the roof lines\nthat were adding match that 4 on 12\nthat's currently\nthere the zoning officer had some\ncomments on um what was existing and\nproposed on the second floor the second\nfloor basically everything from the the\nstair forward is existing and from that\nwall back is what we're proposing uh on\nthe second floor there's currently one\nbedroom uh one bathroom living in the\ndining area and kitchen at the front um\nwhat we're proposing to do is try to\nmimic what we have on the first floor so\n\nwe're incorporating three bedrooms uh to\nthe back um we'll have the two bathrooms\nwe're adding one one bathroom on the\nsecond floor so there'll be two\nbathrooms\nand then expanding the kitchen a little\nbit and um the dining and the living\narea on the first floor the floor plan\nis there basically just we didn't have\nany labels on it she was making comments\nabout that um we just drew to you know\nshow what we're doing up above um again\njust three bedrooms on the first floor\ntwo baths currently on the first floor\nyou know the kitchen and the living\nspace the garage and laundry room behind\nthe garage\nthere's no basement that has a slab on\ngrade uh and there's no attic that 4 on\n12 uh pitch we're only going to have\nlike 3 and 1 12 ft between the top of\nthe the ceiling joist and the bottom of\nthe ridge so it's basically just you\nknow storage space uh we're not going to\nhave anything that's going to be 7 or\nmore that's going to trigger an\ncalculation uh there was a request to\nshow the building height um we have 23t\non the zoning chart uh currently and the\nexisting um would be that same you know\n\n23 plus or minus um well below the 35\nmaximum that's allowed um again like I\nsaid the 4 on 12 pitch is consistent\nwith uh you know a lot of the other\nhomes in the\nneighborhood\num you know and work visually with the\nJason Holmes as kind of mentioned by the\nhistoric conservation Comm\num I reviewed the comments by the other\nTown professionals and saw no major\nobjections of course the building\nofficial Fire official PL will be to\ncode uh the engineer wanted some\ntestimony on that there' be no change to\nthe grade and the work is basically a\nsecond floor Edition so there's no no\nchange to the grade and we agree with\nthe the city Forester that there's\nsufficient um uh um screening around the\nproperty that area in the back that's\nwooded um on the right hand side the\nright hand side neighbor has a nice grow\nof trees um and it's\nwell it's just in conclusion you know\n\nwe're proposing a two-story the second I\nmean a second floor addition uh to\nexpand that second floor so it's the\nsame as the first floor\napartment and there's to be similar to\nthe other two family homes right on that\nstreet\nquestions from the\nprofessionals maybe I can Okay jump in\nand hopefully clarify this through lot\nissue can you clarify the entire\nFrontage along the rear I believe Grove\nStreet if I'm not mistaken um is there\nany pavement any portion of that street\nor is it all it's only on paper where\nokay um you know I did bring a photo\npacket that maybe I can you know there's\nsome Google Earth images that may be\nhelpful with that and and then there's\nsome other photos of the some houses in\nthe neighborhood um you think that might\nbe helpful if you believe it helps we\ncould take a might as well I got yeah so\nthe the definition of through lots and\nthe code specifically refers to Frontage\nand refers to the existence of streets\nand designating them as the you know the\nleast uh traffic intensive one I I don't\nbelieve if there is absolutely no\nPavement in that rear portion I don't\nthink you can realistically call that\nFrontage um it wouldn't be approved if\nan application were submitted to the\ntown so I think I would interpret that\nnot in fact to be a through lot I think\nwe can treat it and you know ignore the\nadditional requirements of um you know\nupdating those setbacks in accordance\nwith the through lot provision treated\nas a normal residential lot that's\nlogical to me you see the lot it's\nlogical\num and and and maybe to tweak it there\nthere are six unpaved streets in Summit\num so we don't want to say not paav but\nI from what I can tell you could not\ndrive a vehicle or even\nwalk behind that\nproperty just just the\num Grove Street where the current\nresidences are was wasn't paav back in\nthe 70s and the developer came through\nand and buil p uh I worked with one of\nthe guys um so um I'm not saying that's\ngoing to happen moving forward just\ngiving you a little bit of history that\nthat was the way it is behind their\nproperty is the way it was up to\nWashington Avenue so I don't know if\nthat affects anything but I'm willing to\ngo with our board attorney said you know\nI was going to say I just didn't want us\nto say if the Street behind isn't paved\nthen it's not a through street because\nthere are six unpaved streets no not not\njust pave for example but not used at\nall as an actual Street I can offer the\nterm not even a walk it's not improved\nnot even a walk unimproved\nyeah I have a a photograph in the packet\nof you know looking down Grove at that\ndead end and you just see that it's all\nwooded so can't even see the red sign of\nyou can't you can't\ntake one and pass\ndown and have these been submitted or if\nnot no I put these out today Mark those\nas one\nyou\nyou can I ask a question sure so so uh\nthere three B proposed three bedrooms on\nthe second floor currently three\nbedrooms on the first floor correct how\ndo you propose to\nparkr these vehicles if there if there\nif each person in the room has a car\nyeah so so uh currently we can park\nthree uh spots in the driveway and one\nin the garage so we'll have four spots\ntotal uh it's a like I said it's a\nbasically a dead end Street couple times\nthat I've been there you know there\nplenty parking on the street too not\nthat\nwe don't want to encourage that exactly\nbut you know in order to get this\ntranscript properly one at a\ntime please Don you want to finish your\ncomment no I I don't think we want to\nencourage overflow parking onto the\nstreet exactly so um just something\nthere's four spots something for the\napplicant to think about yeah there's\nfour spots off\nStreet okay um if you look at the uh a\nbottom photo of the aerial photo you can\nkind of see the massing their houses off\nto the off to the left the dot um the\nhouse directly to their right is\nbasically an identical house uh without\nthat addition that we're proposing and\nthen the second and third houses are are\ntwo family houses um that have a bigger\nmass than what we're proposing so again\nwe we're still you know conservative in\nthe in the massing of the overall uh SCH\non the\nstreet you can see that same thing on on\nthe second page uh the neighbor to the\nright you know there's a consistency and\nthat front facade that we currently\nhave it's kind of ugly you know so\nintroducing that skirt roof uh double\nwindows box Bay we're trying to you know\narticulate the faad give a little bit\nbetter and um the third page uh the top\nphoto you can see the distance\nthe neighbor on the right in our house\num and then the neighbor on on the left\nyou said from the um closest point which\nis that corner because that neighbor's\nhouse on the left is on a skew the\nclosest point is 28 ft and it kind gets\ngreater from that\npoint and again trees wooded a lot of\nbuffer the last page was just for\nconversation for that rear yard but if\nit's not to lot then we'll essentially\njust keep it the way it\nis in that last page um I walked the\nneighborhood um and I marked where\nthere's two families one\nfamilies um just checked for number of\nmailboxes and electric meters to kind of\nyou know determine what was a one family\nwas a two family and got my count from\nthat\n\nokay any other questions I I had just a\ncouple um the you had said was one of\nthe tenants who put the shed in um so\nthen it's\nnot is it just sitting on the dirt is is\nit on has it got a\nfoundation that shed's going to be\ndisappearing pretty soon okay well that\nmakes it we don't have any long-term\nplans for that shed we that's really\neasy it's going to be um and then when\nyou're talking about the addition for\nthe Neighbors um then is it your\ntestimony let's see there are no the\naddition has no windows facing the\nneighbor that's 28 ft\naway no side\ntell that's the um yeah across the creek\nthere are no neighbor okay no windows on\nthat and then for the neighbor that's\ncloser the one window that is being\nadded in the addition is because the\nneighbor doesn't have a second story\nthere you're looking over the roof line\nand not into somebody's bedroom that's\ncorrect thank\nquestions can you just explain again why\nit's hardship to convert this property\nor make this\naddition combine it with the existing\ninto a one family house this is an\ninvestment property for us\nso um it's our retirement plan so we\nwould be collecting two rents instead of\njust one so to to put a one family home\nthere and collect the rent it would be\nwe just couldn't do it the numbers just\ndon't add up\nso I'll I'll just note for our\nconsideration hardship it it doesn't\nconstitute a hardship within the\n\ndefinition of the municipal land use law\nfor the purposes of granting a a C1\nvariance that the economic issues that\nare raised here so what would create the\nhardship uh so I mean there are cases\nthat say complete economic infeasibility\nof a project can constitute a potential\nhardship but I believe the applicants\nare proceeding as not necessarily under\na C1 hardship variance request but a c\nto uh the general positive and negative\ncriteria and special reasons request\nokay because it wouldn't qualify on the\nother okay\ncorrect any other questions from the\nboard any questions from the\npublic um um you had your first shot\nwe'll give this gentleman\nhis come forward\nplease and again remember we're talking\nquestions only\nYeah question is like I'm live on the 15\nWashington Greek can you just state your\nname spell your last name my name Isam\nShakur last name is Shakur s h a k o o\nr so question I I'm just trying to those\ntrees on our side they're going down so\nI don't know that's not a privacy\nanymore they will be going down\nsoon and that Creek is already uh it's\nslowing down it's like uh erosion\nalready so I'm already concerned from my\nside for for my property so those trees\nare already going down so that's not a\nprivacy and that's not a privacy\nquestions yeah I just want to clarify\nthat that was mentioned that trees are\nmaking the Privacy chance to comment at\nthe end of the application is questions\nonly yeah sure um from my side from our\nside I want to make sure is there any\nwindows on our side 15 Washington Avenue\nover\nlike and I want to make sure that\nit's they're building the second\num level and it's on the creek so any\nit's I don't I'm not an engineer it's\ngoing to effect that Creek I don't know\nI just want to raise that\nquestion um and the height of the of\nthe roof is that going to be bigger than\nour or larger than ours I don't know\nthat's the third question I have no your\nyours is much higher than what we have\nwe're going to be the same level as our\nexisting house okay yeah and um\nyeah yeah the lastly I have is like B\nwhen I got the survey we share uh some\npart of questions questions only yeah\nI'm I'm coming listen to me\nplease we when I got a survey that we\nshared some they sh they have some part\non our side and we have some part on\ntheir side so I want to just want to\nmake sure that we are\nnot um coming to each other surve wise\nI'm pointing that so that these are the\nonly questions I\nhave just want to put in front\nof you have a comment to\nthat the property line is where it's at\num yeah the drainage is not the property\nline you know so so part of that\nAdvantage towards the front is on his\nproperty and then it cuts across um kind\nof behind our garage through our\nproperty so um\n\nis okay does that respond to your\nquestion you I'm\nput\nokay I can show you\nguys again I'm not an engine\nlike I think if you're going to try to\npresent the survey that's more\nappropriate for the comments at the end\nof the application not for the questions\nright okay okay any other questions I\nbelieve you had please\nup I sat too long take your\ntime it's what happens when you sit for\na long time well me in 25 you\nknow I'm Joan Conley I live on 12 Middle\nAvenue with my probably property runs\ndown Washington Avenue and I'm sorry I'm\njust confused about the parking\n\nsituation and the amount of traffic that\nwill be flowing down there if this\n\naddition is\npassed could you explain to me again I'm\nsorry I'm a little dense at times about\nyou'll have adequate parking spots so\npeople do not have to park on the street\novernight can I address that you sure\ncan so we've owned the home um we've\nnever met unfortunately we've owned the\nhome since 2004 so my husband and I we\nhad two cars when we lived on the first\nfloor and we often rented to couples who\nlived in the one bedroom on the second\nfloor so we've we've often had just four\ncars there um there's no on street\nparking there at night so correct but\nunfortunately that does happen um if we\nrent to people um I mean you're having\nthree bedrooms up stairs so you that's\ngoing to be at least two two cars right\nthere well they we\n\nthat would be in our contract with our\nrenters which we we have typically done\nI'm sorry that would be in our contract\nwith our renters which we have typically\ndone that they would uh only could have\na certain number of cars sure right\nbecause there's no overnight parking on\nthe streets in suit mhm so we don't\nanticipate there being any more cars\nthere than there than there are now\nbecause we've had four drivers living at\nthat house off and on you know for\nalmost 20 years now so you know we we we\n\nsimply can't rent to somebody who has\nmore than two cars that's a limitation\nof the of the rental agreement and we've\nbeen doing that for 20 years so we would\nobviously continue to do that okay I I\ndon't know what the standard is for\nparking in the arive zone uh I tried to\nlook through and see sorry I don't know\nwhat the standard is for the town\nrequirements for parking in the R zone\nwe try to find\nit the zone that we're in for property\nyeah you can't over Park overnight on\n\nStreet from 2:30 to 5: in the morning\nright we're providing two spots off\nStreet on the property uh per unit so\nthere's two units now so that'd be a\ntotal of four four that's correct right\nthere's two units now and there will be\ntwo units and there will be a\nstipulation that that's sure this way we\nboth done because there's no other\noption some has a teenage driver they\nthey don't want to rent the property\nbecause there's no place for the car\nthank you great thank you\nokay any other\nquestions do I need to introduce myself\nagain yeah we're good yeah we're good no\nokay so this is questions yes so oh I\nhave many questions um so how much of\nthe backyard are we going to be cutting\ninto because I have not heard anyone\nmention that this is a flood zone there\nis a brook right next door to this\nhouse uh according to engineer dra ditch\nokay when there is a storm drainage\nditch is not going to cut\nit I can that right now we do have a\nmemo here from the\ncity uh relative to the zoning permit\nthat was at the application of\nconstruction floor second floor and\nexisting development property was\n\nflagged by uh due to its location in the\nflood plane uh and according to this the\nU available flood elevation data for the\nimmediate area indicates the 1% annual\n\nchance of flood deviation is\napproximately\n193.50 ft which would be fully contained\nwithin the stream channel further more\nthe project is limited to the second\nfloor therefore no work is proposed at\ngrade as such a flood plane development\npermit is not required for the project\nand the application can continue to be\nreviewed and heard at the board so\nthat's what they're telling us is that\nit's not an issue because they're only\ndoing work on the second\nfloor but you're putting a second\naddition an addition on it or won't you\nbe cutting into the into the land itself\nyou're not cutting into the backyard\nyou're just going up what going up\nthey're telling us that this is not an\nissue they don't have to go for a flood\nplane permit and that it can just be\nconsidered as a regular normal\napplication okay my second question is\num I have heard repeatedly that parking\nis not an issue I invite you to come\nback 10 11:00 tonight and tell me\n\nparking isn't an\nissue the experience because as as we\nall know in the city of summit you're\nnot supposed to par on the again\nquestions only but you can my question\nso there's going to be ample parking for\nit now what hypothetically so in your\nyour lease you're going to maintain that\nonly two cars per unit correct sure of\ncourse because right now we are far\nexceeded excuse me exceeded\nthat um so that that's of concern well\nthe other the other option is if there's\nparking on the stet that doesn't belong\nthere you can call the police and have\ntick it up once one person started to do\nit everybody started doing it well\nthat's what's going to then then you\neverybody everybody can pay the tickets\nI understand why one person does it I\nget it he's a cop but everybody\nelse that's my I'm not going to get into\nthe enforcement police tell you where\nit's at okay I can't do that I live\nthere so these are my concerns you have\nany other well you can certainly talk\nabout that at the end when you're\nallowed to provide your opinion\nany other questions you address the U\nparking that's it thank\nyou\nokay um we have handled questions uh do\nwe\nhave Mr chairman Mr chairman sorry\nplease raise my hand um\nquestion there was a question regarding\nthe parking requirement and really in\nthis application for a two family you\nrefer to the rsis residential site\nImprovement standards for parking and\nfor a three bedroom right they're both\nthree bedrooms it's two parking spaces\nper unit I'm sorry it's how many two two\nparking space which is what they're\nproviding correct\ncorrect so they are it's in doing what\nthey're supposed to do and the um I\ndon't know if you're considering a\ncondition of the uh on the lease but uh\nthey're not uh they can't put more than\ntwo spaces for them and if they go on\nthe street they're in violation of\nMunicipal\nstatute\nokay is there anything else from any\nboard\nmember\nokay uh at this point then we will go to\nanybody who wants to tell us what they\nthink of this application which is now\nwhere you can come be sworn and tell us\nwhat you think of the application\nseeing no this is for the\npublic um seeing no one coming\nforward um you have anything else to add\nto what's been presented from you this\nis your chance to wrap up\nand okay well I've just I've just heard\nthe concerns of my neighbors and you\nknow we want to be good neighbors we\nlive in Summit as well so we'll\ndefinitely do what we can to alleviate\nparking issues and D driving issues by\nyou know not running to people who have\nyou know multiple cars so okay\ndefinitely I've I've just heard their\nissues and we'll try to accommodate in\nevery way we can okay thank you um any\nconditions and of requirements sure the\nusual um single condition complies with\nthose conditions noted in our board\nEngineers memorandum I know there's been\ntalk of a potential limitation on\nparking I don't know if the board feels\nthat that's necessary since the required\nparking is being\nprovided oh I think uh just I get deal\ndealt with that and uh yep I'll withdraw\nmy\nsuggestion so that that was the only\nsingle condition then that I had noted\num we're dealing with C variances so\nfour affirmative votes are required to\napprove okay so we will move into\nexecutive session at this\npoint um who would like to kick it off\nMiss to quiet I just see hand go no I'm\nI'm suggesting that the right hand side\nof the DI is okay I'll turn this side\nwho wants to\nstart I'll I'll I'll start I mean I just\nI keep going back to um the zoning\nofficer's first point\nabout not considering it an existing\nperforming\ncondition\num by adding the second floor versus it\nbeing one um I'm not sure what to make\nof it yet to be honest with you\nlike because like there were two two\npoints that she had made the point that\nit is a through lot we've determined\nit's not a through lot right um what's\nour point of view on existing\nnonconformance on the lot area you're\nsaying yeah it it struck me as a bit\nstrange as well um I can't say I've seen\nthat interpretation before where in they\nexpanded building you know the lot size\nisn't changing it's not being made any\nsmaller so I wouldn't necessarily jump\nout and say it's required I know the\napplicants did though apply for that\nvariance so to the extent that you know\nwe're dealing with C variances anyway I\nI say they're seeking that variance we\nshould treat it as such and formally\nconsider that variance this evening just\nto be sure that that issue is addressed\ninto the future but yes it it is you\nknow the the size lot isn't changing\nnothing's being subdivided off or you\nknow being minimized there yes the\nstructure is in theory getting slightly\nlarger as compared to the lot but um the\noverall dimensions are not\nimpacted\nokay anyone else want to chime\nin I'm still not\nnot really comfortable with the some\nissues here first of all the the limits\nof the the um boundaries of the lot are\nnot well determined I don't know exactly\nwhere this property ends or uh and I I\nrecall one of the uh neighbors raised\nthis point and I'm having also\ndifficulty seeing\nwhere the size of the lot and the limits\nof it and we have here uh when the\narchitect spoke about the distance\nbetween he spoke between the houses not\nbetween the offset from the uh existing\nuh Lots borders so um uh I think we need\na better survey than that than the\nexisting that I'm looking at for the\ntime being uh to avoid any future so\nmaybe we have a condition of approval\nlike a uh a better\nsurvey I don't know if that's a legal\nterm I I think you could ask three\ndifferent surveyors to survey this slot\nyou're going to get the same thing back\nunfortunately right they they have very\nstrict parameters in which they observe\nand record data and then put it in the\ncomputer and what's going on with this\nlot is that it's not going to be sorted\nout by any server right it sounds like\nit's a a legal gray area that I don't\nthink we want to weit it into tonight\n\nright it's not our it's not our perview\nit's not our it's not our mission it's\nnot our purview that's right Mr chairman\nthat's a great way of do it I think we\njust have to deal with the matters at\nhand and I think what they presented\ntonight is pretty clear cut\nwhat they're asking for so we have to\ndecide whether or not that's\nreasonable\nright variances they ask\nfor you know are they reasonable do they\ndo the positive criteria outweigh the\nnegative criteria right are they staying\nwithin the spirit of the drro this is\nwhat we have to consider tonight and I\nI'm a little confused what what exactly\nare you looking to clarify this the\nsurvey is as as Mr ly showing uh 7 foot\nyeah and this is It's a certified\ncomplete survey yes I I think it's this\nAndy I think it's the fact that this\npart of the what's happening offsite yes\nyes that happens to be attached to their\nyeah that that driveway that's not the\nsurveyor within their purview they they\ncan't survey adjacent properties and be\ncompelled to provide the drainage or you\nknow the creek areas there um the survey\nof this property is complete and meets\nstatutory\ncriteria right and the fact that the tax\nmag doesn't accurately reflect what's\nactually going on is not on them at all\nno and that's I I won't say fairly\ncommon but that happens uh you you have\npaper streets like these that are\nunimproved and the reality of what\nbehind what's behind there we've\naddressed through testimony\nand that's what uh triggers the\nuh combined\nsetbacks no no no the combined setback\nis based on the the total side yard of\nthe existing house and we we have those\nsetbacks clearly delineated in the\nsurvey yes at seven and seven and a half\nyes\nso all of this stuff on the left hand\nside would just white\nout it it's any sense it's not relevant\nto this to the setback determination\ndon't don't pay any attention to it even\nthough we'd like\nto even if we wanted to which we don't\nwe would not solve it tonight yes so\nthere's really no point waiting in those\nWaters okay I me it's clearly clearly an\nunusual property but just to focus on\nwhat the applicants is proposing to do I\nmean it's a two family house now the yes\nthey are proposing to make it larger but\nit's in scale with you know several\nother properties on the\nBlock um they're in compliance with with\nthe parking so whatever parking problems\nthere are now they're not going to make\nit any worse um so in spite of you know\nI there's some really good questions\nhere but as has been noted they're not\nreally for us to address tonight so I I\nI think I can support the application\nbased on based on the fact that that\nreally not significally increasing the\n\nintensity of use and it is in scale with\nthe other structures on the Block excuse\nme I agree I think in terms of it being\nin scale it was was an important\ndecision for me too so I do support this\napption we can't pay attention to the\nneighborhood we have to uh deal with the\nproperty that's put in front of us and\nuh I think that makes all the sense in\nthe world to deal with it that way and\nuh all the positives are there and the\nfact that there's no um and that the\ncity has gone ahead and checked on the\nthe drainage issues to make sure that we\ndon't have a problem and that the that\nthe neighbors won't have a problem and\nuh that makes uh makes the positives\noutweigh the negatives and I would\naccept a motion at this point to approve\nthe uh application\nmoved\nsecond Vice chairman lyet yes Mr Yuko\nyes Mr Nelson yes Mr Kieran yes Mr Malay\nyes Miss tote yes chairman Steiner yes\nthe motion carries okay congratulations\ngood luck hopefully you'll I think your\nneighbors are waiting to talk to you\nwhich would be good uh and uh certainly\nuh something we want to\ndo we've got a couple more motions for\nextension don't we yeah\num ahe we have a number of resolutions\nyes so we have resolution only two of\nthem left\nanymore want me\nto if the board would like us to weigh\nin on what on the the two resolutions\nfor extensions sure um first one was uh\nciting financial reasons as the basis\nfor the request that's 185 Oakridge\nAvenue uh again the request was for the\nthe first request for another year\nextension there um 28 Druid Hill uh\n\ncited that they would ideally like to\nhave more time they have very young\nchildren a newborn baby attempting to uh\ndo the project at the this time is not\nfeasible for them again requesting a\none-year\nextension excuse us folks we need excuse\nus in the back of the room folks please\nplease

This played a crucial role in swaying the zoning board's opinion, particularly given initial hesitations around the extensive floor area variance. By the end of the hearing, the board was convinced that the modest additions would harmonize well with the streetscape, especially acknowledging that many properties in the vicinity also featured front porches.\n\nThe application garnered unanimous support from the zoning board members, leading to a formal approval conditioned on adherence to the engineer's stipulations.

brief but um so the property\nowner at 7332 Springfield Avenue has\nrequested approval to remove a tree\nthat's located in the front yard of\n\ntheir property and viewable from public\nRightWay uh to residential property the\nhouse dates back to 1912 and is\nconsidered a contributing structure to\nthe historic district um section 10f\nPage 6 two of our HDC guidelines states\nthat mature trees particularly those\nthat can be seen from a public right\naway are important defining are\nimportant to defining the character of\nthe historic district um and it also\nstates that no tree over 12 in in\ndiameter may be removed without approval\nfrom the historic district commission uh\nthe applicant is claiming that the tree\nin question is dead and present a safety\nhazard to the residents or to Residents\nand visitors to the property um staff\nwas able to speak with a tree expert uh\nfrom ohw Inc which is a tree company\nthat we actually use here in town that\nwe recommended to them um I did request\nthat they send me an email or something\nwriting they didn't do that but I did\ntalk to them and I can confirm that the\ntree expert uh you know confirmed that\nthe tree is dead and they recommended\nthat it be taken down um so HC is being\nasked to determine if removal of the\ntree at 7332 Springfield Avenue is\nappropriate or to recommend alternative\nactions such as pruning in order to\nmitigate any potential safety hazards uh\nbut considering the information uh\npresent from the tree expert and our\nobservations as well staff does\nrecommend approval of the application\nand allowing the immediate removal of\nthe tree and then um I added a suggested\nMotion in there um hopefully if you guys\nwant to use it you don't have to but\nit's uh there again it's a just common\npractice that that we've been using in\nour other um committees and commissions\nso um included it there as well uh as as\nyou guys know the applicant wasn't able\nto make it tonight but I did speak to\nthem there were some extenda\ncircumstances that so um we're okay with\nthat U could somebody bring up the\nphotos yeah\nyeah okay as you see is the trees on the\nleft hand side of image\nanual is there any conversation\nregarding this application any\nquestions I think we've all gone past\nthe tree yeah yeah it's pretty I'm not a\ntree expert but it's been in Decline for\nabout 10 years yeah is there um is is\nthere anything in the guidelines because\nI I looked at it briefly that talks\nabout you know what to do with stumps or\nanything like that or to replace a tree\nwith the tree that you're removing\ncertain any has that ever been part of\nany discussions not that I remember okay\nno didn't we talk about potentially\nhaving an approved species list maybe\npotentially so there is a town we do\nhave our in our town landscape\nguidelines we do have an approved um you\nknow species list for um you know that's\nusually used for new construction and\nsubdivisions and such but it it can\napply to uh you know any anything in\ntown basically um it comes from the\ncounty it's their approved species list\nso is that something that we could send\nto anybody who's having a tree removed\nas just a reference certainly\nokay great idea I noticed here that\ntrees that are not Hardy or well suited\n\nfor the climate but it doesn't say you\ncan't plant them yeah I mean our so our\nlandscape guidelines like I said those\nare generally for when we're approving\num subdivisions as a town uh we can't\nnecessarily enforce everyone in town to\nplant only certain types of trees um\nhowever in the historic district\nobviously uh we do have at least those\nguidelines that we can follow but you\nknow folks outside this District can\ndon't don't necessarily have to follow\nthat or what's in our landscape\nguidelines it also gets a little dicey\nbecause historically they may have been\nplanting some less native species as a\ndecoration you know especially turn of\nthe century that would have been a very\npopular thing so then you're almost\nprescribing something more out of\ncharacter with the with the time\nperiod yeah I was part of part of my\njust thought process was if if we're\nremoving a tree do we just request a\nanother tree to be put in just yeah it's\na good thought yeah but at least put a\nsuggestion out there you can't hurt\nyeah it's never a bad thing to have\nanother tree yeah especially on that\nstreet yeah for sure yeah I don't think\nour guidelines require it but again it's\none of those things where we we can\nalways ask the applicant you know if\nthey if they'd be willing to to do a\nlittle bit extra and we don't can't\nrequire it but um you a lot of times\nfolks are happy to comply when it's\nstuff like replacing a tree things like\nthat\nbecause the approval letter we send them\nwe can say hey we recommend trees in the\n\nlandscape guidelines and we can send\nthem a link to that as well so friend of\nmine sent me uh I'm not sure a Carol\n\nCounty tree program where once a year\nyou can tell them it's I think you get\n20 tree or 10 trees for $20 or something\nlike that and they're all Native species\nyeah and so I don't know if that's a\nresource we can put like as a tagline in\nthere and say hey there's a program out\nthere for inexpensive native trees yeah\nwe love as many trees as we can get in\ntown yeah there's a there's a state\nprogram too for native trees it's only\nat participating nurseries but you get\num $25 off native species if you fill\nout the voucher and bring it in um it's\non the state's website yeah that could\nbe another thing we could include with\nan approval letter sticking the things\nto help people out a little bit for sure\nall right is there a motion on this\napplication then we can include on that\nmotion the suggestion of planting a\ntree I'll make a motion to approve\napplication 202 24-23 for tree removal\nat 7332 Springfield\nAvenue okay do we want to add that\nstipulation of suggestion of replanting\na tree in the you know suggested area to\nreplace it it's something that um\ncoincides with the uh natural habitat or\nnatural species of\nMaryland okay is there a second on that\nmotion second okay all in\nfavor opposed motion\ncarries okay any uh reports this evening\nuh nothing for me evening okay great\nonly one that I've got is to say thank\nyou for uh letting me be the lead aison\nfor the past eight years now now you\nguys are stuck with me you're in good\nhands with Kevin but I'm still around if\nyou need me get your home ear there huh\na little bit earlier nice nice we ought\nto be thanking you you just done a very\ngood job thank you organizing everything\nokay is there a motion to uh dismiss the\nmeeting this

"body": "In a meeting convened on the evening of June 26, the Sykesville Historic District Commission reviewed and approved an application for the removal of a tree located at 7332 Springfield Avenue. The property, a residential home dating back to 1912, is considered a contributing structure within the historic district. \n\nThe property owner submitted the application citing safety concerns, as the tree in question was reportedly dead. The staff corroborated this claim after consulting a tree expert from OHW Inc., a town-recommended tree company. The expert confirmed the tree's poor condition and recommended its immediate removal.\n\nAccording to Section 10f, Page 62 of the Historic District Commission guidelines, mature trees visible from public spaces are essential to defining the district's character. The guidelines stipulate that no tree over 12 inches in diameter may be removed without the commission's approval. \n\nThere was some discussion among commission members regarding potential alternative actions, such as pruning, but the consensus supported removal due to the confirmed hazard. The commission also considered introducing a stipulation for planting a new tree in place of the removed one. An approved species list from the town's landscape guidelines was discussed as a helpful resource for residents.\n\nThe motion to approve the application included a recommendation for the property owner to plant a tree conforming to the state's approved native species. The motion was seconded and passed unanimously.\n\nCommission members also discussed various programs, including local and state initiatives, that offer discounted native tree species. These resources will be recommended in the approval letter to the applicant.\n\nIn other business, the commission approved the minutes from the May 22, 2024 meeting and discussed minor adjustments. The meeting adjourned with expressions of gratitude towards long-time members for their service.\n\nThis decision aligns with the commission's commitment to preserving the historic character of Sykesville while addressing present-day safety concerns.", "keywords": ["Sykesville", "Historic District", "Tree Removal", "Safety Hazard", "Property Guidelines", "Historic Preservation"]}, {"title": "Sykesville Historic District Commission Approves Meeting Minutes with Minor Adjustments", "body": "The Sykesville Historic District Commission convened on the evening of June 26, where members reviewed the minutes from their previous meeting held on May 22, 2024.

This correction was the only change discussed. Following this, a motion was put forth to approve the revised minutes. \n\nThe motion to approve was moved and seconded, passing without opposition.

much for\nfollowing through back in January the\nnorth e water district said it would be\nasking the Eber Water Agency to help out\nwith extending the water lines to the\nOregon house area I'm not

three consider approval\nrevisions of the community impact Grant\nand Loan program policy including\nconsideration of increase in the annual\nmaximum of the bill Shaw rescue\nequipment and training grants from\n10,000 to 20,000 Jim hey good morning Mr\nchair and board members Jim matrician\nI'm your organizational development\nofficer it's good to see you again it's\nbeen a while uh I wanted to bring this\nuh item or we wanted to bring this item\nto you uh after some consideration from\nuh the Pod committee some stakeholder\nmeeting that occurred back in April 17th\nuh grant program staff at the agency all\ncontributed to the revisions that you\nsee before you today uh I'll just give a\nquick summary and an overview and happy\nto answer any questions that you might\nhave um hopefully we had an opportunity\nto read it uh so the recommended updates\nto the policy are largely clarifications\nin just modernization of the language uh\nbased on what we've learned over the\nlast four years uh since the Poli was\npolicy was originally adopted in October\nof 2020 uh we did receive input put from\nthe Pod committee on March 4th and that\nstakeholder meeting which included about\n30 people on April 17th uh all positive\nfeedback nothing significant was\nsuggested for policy edits at that time\nso we scheduled it for the board uh\nconsideration today so you will note on\nthere that there are no changes to the\n\nsix primary funding areas that was in\nthe policy back in 2020 we've kept those\nthe same those are flood risk reduction\nwater supply and Water Management water\nuh Watershed resilience water education\nwater conservation and the bill Shaw\nrescue equipment and training grants uh\npolicy does separate out uh these\nfunding areas by specifying that our\ncore Mission areas are flood risk\nreduction and water supply and Water\nManagement the other four funding areas\nare categorized as a community impact\nMission area so kind of the difference\nthere we want to invest in uh invest our\ndollars in the core Mission areas of\nflood risk obviously and uh water supply\nthose are our core uh Mission areas and\nthen the other for uh Community impact\nwe typically see smaller amounts in\nthose areas so we do recommend um a cap\nfor those so we'll talk about that um we\nare recommending that the board adopt a\npractice focusing uh funding for\nprioritized projects within core Mission\nareas absent to predefined funding\nmaximum typically over the last four\nyears that has been a $10 million cap\nand we further recommend the board adopt\na maximum of $2.5 million for each\nfiscal year for projects that fall\nwithin the other four funding areas uh\nfor a community\nimpact\nthe I think that was it oh there's one\nmore thing with that the figure of 2.5\nwas derived over the last five years of\ndata we looked at kind of where those\nlanded and determined that that was a a\nmore than reasonable amount to to\nestablish as our first year um as going\nforward uh to be clear all applications\nfor Grant and Loans uh must comply uh\nwith the agency act our mission areas of\ncourse uh the Strategic plan Etc so we\n\ndo uh stress that that still applies\ntoday uh before you at the Pod committee\nuh back in March director vasque has\n\nbrought up the concept of increasing the\nbill Shaw grants from\n$10,000 uh per fiscal year to $20,000\nper fiscal year for our First Responders\nuh agencies within the county and that's\nwhy it's on your agenda today to\n\nactually contemplate that we wanted to\nbring that forward so I'm happy to ask\nthere any questions\nclarifications thank you any questions\nof the directors\nhere I hand you the microphone let's get\na microphone for sit\ndown let's see testing okay uh I think\nit's the start of the third

this matter\nmotion okay director vas has made a\nmotion and director Matthews has\nseconded all in favor please raise your\nhand okay let it be known for the record\nevery director voted yes thank you Mr\nchair yes thank\nyou okay manager's\nreport all right good morning this\nmeeting's going going uh pretty quick\nhere um so um happy to report new\nBullards Bar is full and has been for\nabout a week and a half and will be for\nthe next several weeks we're seeing um a\ndecrease in the snow melt now um but\nstill some significant inflows coming in\n\num I went by the power system\nheadquarters last Wednesday to check on\nprogress uh things are going well I\nthink there's a tour set up um soon for\na couple folks that wanted to go see it\num I'd encourage you to go see it if\npossible if you need uh to set up tour\nlet me\nknow um last week we had our annual\ninspection of new bullers bar Dam with\nuh dsod uh that went well we also\noperated the low-level Outlet um as part\nof the uh the inspection uh requirement\nand um the only comments we had were\nminor maintenance and housekeeping items\num all in all that's a pretty big\nmilestone you know we have two\nRegulators that regulate our dam firk\nand um division of safety of dams this\nis the state entity and that's who was\nlast week so I want to thank Tim and\nBrian for um you know the good work they\ndo managing new Bull\nBar um on the maintenance side um we\ncompleted the Narrows 2 annual outage\nlast week and we had planned to return\nit to service at the end of last week\nhowever um the intake gate um which is\nin englebright Reservoir um the cable\nthat um operates that intake gate was\nfrayed and broke um we're procuring a\nnew cable um it's going to take a week\nto get the cable and a week to to\ninstall the cable it comes from Ohio um\nso narrow 2 has not returned to service\num due to this um broken intake gate\ncable um it's hard to tell exactly what\ncaused the fraying and the breaking of\nthe cable but it suspected that um Woody\n\ndebris that's caused by The Spill at\nenglebright um frayed the cable itself\nwhile it was closed during the outage so\num it's unfortunate that um we didn't\nget the unit back um at the end of last\nweek but we're doing everything we can\nto get it back as soon as possible\nuh Narrows one and the Colgate units\nremain\nonline um as far as weather goes we have\nuh a pretty significant heat event not\nrecord-breaking by any means but the\nfirst significant heat event of the year\ntoday through Thursday and then um very\nlikely another high pressure system\ncoming in Monday through Wednesday next\nweek so um we'll see additional snow\nmelt um probably the tail end of the\nsnow melt next week um and power prices\nwill likely um increase now that into\nthe hot part of\nSummer spilling of new Bullard bar we\nhad we didn't spill through the spill\nGates but uh two weeks ago we um opened\nthe low-level Outlet to um gain about 2\n200 acre feet of space in new Bullard\nbar or allow for 2 200 acre feet of\ninflow so it wasn't through the spill\nGates it was through the low level out\nit was like a\nday what what could it pass for capacity\n12 well in an emergency scenario 3,000\nCFS and under normal operating\nconditions 1,200 and I think we um used\nit at a at a rate of about a thousand\nCFS on the

The funds, aimed at enhancing the local fire district, were a notable topic of discussion.\n\nSharp highlighted the importance of these grants, particularly in increasing the efficiency and safety of fire hydrants and water lines in his area. He mentioned that while the North E Water District had plans to extend water lines to Oregon House, immediate needs could be met by leveraging the agency's existing 150,000-gallon water tank. Additionally, Sharp suggested that Rises Crossing could be realigned and widened simultaneously.\n\nThis grant is part of a broader effort by the local government to address critical infrastructure needs and ensure that emergency services remain well-equipped. The board, influenced by Director Vasquez's strong advocacy, showcased unanimous support for this initiative.", "keywords": ["fire district grants", "Charles Sharp", "Oregon House", "Bill Shaw grants", "Director Vasquez"]}, {"title": "Local Government Reviews Community Impact Grant and Loan Program", "body": "During a comprehensive discussion at the recent municipality meeting, the board considered revisions to the Community Impact Grant and Loan Program. Jim Matrician, the Organizational Development Officer, presented the proposed updates, which aim to modernize and clarify the existing policy based on four years of practical experience.\n\nThe recommended revisions do not alter the six primary funding areas, which include flood risk reduction, water supply management, watershed resilience, water education, water conservation, and the Bill Shaw rescue equipment and training grants. Instead, the policy clarifications intend to ensure a transparent and efficient grant allocation process.\n\nOne key update involves categorizing funding areas into core and community impact mission areas. The board proposes focusing significant funds on core missions such as flood risk reduction and water supply management. For community impact areas, a $2.5 million annual cap is suggested. This figure is derived from five years of data and aims to maintain fiscal responsibility.\n\nDirector Vasquez also proposed increasing the Bill Shaw grants from $10,000 to $20,000 per year to better support first responders.

The inspection included the operation of the low-level outlet, with only minor maintenance and housekeeping comments noted. This milestone attests to the diligent management of the facility, overseen by Tim and Brian, who were commended for their work.\n\nHowever, the meeting also highlighted a recent setback involving the intake gate cable at Narrows 2. The cable, responsible for operating the intake gate at Englebright Reservoir, was found frayed and broken, likely due to woody debris from spills. A new cable is being procured, with an expected installation timeframe of two weeks.\n\nIn unrelated news, the board also discussed upcoming weather events, including a significant heatwave that is expected to accelerate snowmelt and potentially increase power prices.
